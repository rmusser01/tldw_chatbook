# PR 2427 rebase reconciliation — 2026-09-06

Tracked by TASK-31932. This is an in-progress integration record, not a merge-readiness claim.

## Git state

The 176 review commits were replayed onto dev `c4d45c0926580a8756cfa13c5463b1d0fc808c1a`.
Rebased checkpoint: `7bd5b9f4a38bd988db900b6dc5faa885bb56e5e2`.
The original pushed head `0135bc20190bba55fc2b48d3d5863ffe1ea449dc`
is retained on `codex/dev-test-review-backup-0135bc2019`.
The original dirty user checkout and every worktree are preserved.

Conflict resolutions retain upstream Prompts state/controller ownership, Media
path redaction/recovery callouts and speaker-rename cache, named handoff timing,
Canvas terminal transaction contributions, locked promotion publication, and
Buddy listening cleanup. The review's ownership and lifecycle repairs remain.

After committing the reconciliation as `aab86d1b87`, the 177-commit series
rebased cleanly onto the newer dev `c47e0da6002475416240252b2954fcf9761d4aac`,
producing `438f6e9122188c5a92d445715d90ce36cff1b140`. The tree delta from the
preceding checkpoint is exactly dev's six files for Persona Inspector avatar
clearing and boot-worker warning handling. Backlog and diagnostic inventory
checks pass again on this revision. The bounded PR Fast Lane plus those two
newly landed test files completed with 840 passed and eight failures in 331.25s:
all eight are the new boot-worker warning probe's premature Loguru sink lifetime.
Evidence: `/private/tmp/pr2427-latest-dev-fast-lane.xml` and its matching log.

## Review-only task renumbering

The user-approved policy preserves upstream task identities even where a review
task has the earlier creation date. The final machine census found **31**
collisions (earlier prose counts 33/34 were counting errors). Immediately before
allocation, a NUL-delimited prefix scan covered 1,029 refs and 319 worktrees:
maximum 31900, with 31901–31932 unused. The CLI subsequently created TASK-31932.

Only the following review-created records moved. Creation dates, completed work,
literal XML/log paths and historical collision reports are retained. Mixed
documents were edited by classified reference line, not by global ID replacement.
Earlier checkpoint statements that 31714/31737/31758 remained duplicated are
historical and are superseded by this mapping.

Upstream TASK-31861's renumbering provenance refers historically to review
TASK-31825, which now resolves to TASK-31931; its own former Canvas ID remains
unchanged. The upstream document is preserved as historical evidence.

## Fresh verification

Initial six-file post-rebase selection: **356 passed, 6 failed**, 2 dependency
warnings, 104.36s. Evidence: `/private/tmp/pr2427-rebase-initial.xml` and matching
log. Failures: Console 17312/16811 line ceiling; Library slack; Media browse
478/371 line ceiling; Conversations controller slack; stale Library assembly
order; Ingest modal presenter inventory. Media behavioral cases passed.

The corrected complete six-file architecture/modal/Media selection has **360
passed, 2 failed**, 2 warnings, 98.69s. Only genuine Console 17312/16811 and Media
browse 478/371 size failures remain. Library and Conversations budgets were
tightened to measured reductions; neither failing ceiling was raised. The
assembly assertion now covers dev's Prompts construction order, and the Ingest
modal edge points to its actual controller. Evidence:
`/private/tmp/pr2427-rebase-inventory-qualified.xml` and matching log.

The complete Canvas, dispatch recovery, roleplay, dictation, and character
navigation selection has **138 passed**, 6 warnings, 135.88s. The first run's
40 missing-html5lib failures were isolated-environment setup: the declared
dependency is now installed in that temporary environment, without dependency
or original-checkout changes. The new dictation regression calls the existing
dictation owner instead of retired private screen delegates. Native attribution
still found seven character-navigation cases retaining fixture-owned SQLite
handles, so passing behavior alone did not qualify resource cleanup. Evidence:
`/private/tmp/pr2427-rebase-behavior-qualified.xml` and matching log.

The complete agent-loop, Prompts state/seam/wiring/characterization, and durable
turn acceptance files have **247 passed**, 3 warnings, 29.28s, with no
`FD_RETAINED` entries. Evidence: `/private/tmp/pr2427-rebase-owner-contracts.xml`
and matching log.

CSS bundle reproduction, profile-owned path census, 113-table allowlist and
281-index decision census pass. Backlog Guard passes across 3,538 records after
the 31 renumbers and new reconciliation task. The diagnostic manifest was
regenerated only after reviewing 49 Console and four Library statements moving
to their existing controller owners: 48 Console and all four Library statements
match exactly; the remaining watchdog warning retains its copy and level with
the owner-injected timeout argument. No diagnostic statements were added to
either screen and sink topology is unchanged. The refreshed inventory verifies
596 owners and 12 sink files.

Duplicate constructor imports have been removed; undefined/redefined-name
checks across affected runtime owners and scoped full lint checks pass. Existing
canonical Library screen re-export imports remain intact. No full-repository
sweep was requested or run.

The new character-navigation file now opts into the same exact-owner real-app
fixture adapter as adjacent reuse tests. Its three constructors use the existing
builder; no behavior assertions or shared fixture internals changed. The complete
file and shared cleanup fault controls have **20 passed**, 3 warnings, 51.53s,
with zero `FD_RETAINED` entries.
Evidence: `/private/tmp/pr2427-rebase-character-resources.xml` and matching log.

## Integration gates

Do not merge until required checks pass and Qodo has reviewed the final revision.
Absence of Qodo comments and the draft-skipped CodeRabbit check are not review
approval. A thread heartbeat watches PR 2427; pause it after confirmed normal merge.

The Console Canvas/citation ownership cleanup still awaits the user's design
approval. Media browse remains 107 lines over its unchanged ceiling; its recovery
and independent page/facet fences must be preserved in any separately reviewed
ownership reduction. Publication is a progress/review checkpoint, not permission
to merge with these failures.

## First published review follow-up

Checkpoint `71389e02b13644654fe1a131d04c1a7027b2ed6e` was published with the exact
lease on the former PR head, and PR 2427 was opened for normal review. Qodo
posted five findings on that revision. CodeRabbit's success status is a skipped
review because the base is not the default branch; it is not an approval.

The new boot-worker capture repeats the already repaired TASK-31901 lifecycle
bug: app startup removes the sink installed before mount. It now captures only
inside the mounted observation window, preserving all three worker state probes
and the positive unknown-worker control. Worker factory imports are hoisted to
module scope so existing exact-app cleanup adapters can capture their products.
The unmounted smoke app remains a real TldwCli constructor and additionally
registers its exact prompts/media handles for current-thread close. The complete
worker/smoke files plus shared fault controls pass **42 tests**, 3 warnings,
33.96s (`/private/tmp/pr2427-worker-smoke-resources.xml` and matching log).

Resource qualification is **not complete**: the same log still attributes
workspace/collections handles to 12 worker cases and prompts/media handles to
smoke initialization. Existing callbacks removed the other auxiliaries. The DB
APIs close only the caller thread's connection; app initialization opens the
smoke databases in its own thread pool, and mounted workers also acquire
thread-local connections. No global closure, GC workaround, threshold relaxation,
or new cross-thread lifecycle implementation was added. A separately reviewed
owner-lifecycle solution is still required.

Qodo triage:

- `3944734941`: modal-transfer diagnostic context — open, needs privacy-safe
  failure-path design and regression verification.
- `3944734944`: settings-durability diagnostic context — open; raw exception text,
  credentials, drafts, and user-entered provider/model labels must not be added
  merely to satisfy a logging recommendation.
- `3944734946`: submission import ordering — corrected to stdlib, third-party,
  then local groups without altering imported symbols.
- `3944734948`: app accessor documentation — added its borrowed-instance return
  contract; runtime access remains unchanged.
- `3944734949`: alleged historical disclosure callback slot — the suggested
  reversal would restore the regression. Commit `8e1d9c72b6` introduced the
  disclosure callback before the established eighth continuation slot on Aug 30;
  its parent has `call_model_with_continuation` immediately after `clock`.
  TASK-31765 restores that older contract while retaining keyword disclosure.
  Do not silently undo that repair on the basis of the current-base diff alone.

The complete first-review checkpoint selection (incremental agent persistence,
tool disclosure, settings durability/navigation, dispatch recovery, worker events,
smoke, and cleanup fault controls) has **152 passed**, 3 warnings, 47.91s.
Evidence: `/private/tmp/pr2427-first-qodo-checkpoint.xml` and matching log.
It verifies the positional continuation and keyword disclosure contracts and
the non-behavioral Qodo corrections. Its native probe reports 42 retained-path
cases: 29 incremental agent-persistence cases, 12 worker cases, and smoke
initialization. These remain resource findings, not a resource-clean
qualification. Agent-persistence ownership still needs targeted attribution;
the worker/smoke cross-thread findings above have been diagnosed.
