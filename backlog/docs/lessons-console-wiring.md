# Lessons: Console screen-to-runtime wiring

Working knowledge about wiring ChatScreen callables into the Console
controller/store runtime. Not decisions (see `backlog/decisions/`) — these
are traps that have actually cost time here, kept so the next person does
not rediscover them.

**Every entry states the incident that produced it.** A lesson without its
evidence decays into folklore, and folklore gets ignored. If you add one,
bring the incident.

## A `console_view_hooks()` entry with no declared slot is silently inert

**TASK-32482 (tasks 6 and 7), 2026-09-11.** The chat-fork feature wired two
new screen→controller callables — `set_pending_chat_create` (arming the
confirm card) and `complete_agent_chat_create` (landing the created chat as
a session) — and in both tasks the wiring passed its own new tests while
doing nothing in production. The cause: `_bind_view_hooks`
(`tldw_chatbook/Chat/console_runtime.py`) does not copy whatever the view's
`console_view_hooks()` map returns. It iterates the declared
`CONSOLE_VIEW_HOOK_SLOTS` tuple and sets
`hooks.get(slot.name, slot.viewless_default)` — an entry the map provides
that has no matching declared slot is silently dropped, leaving the
controller attribute at its (inert or fail-closed) viewless default. The
guard is exhaustive in both directions:
`test_attach_and_detach_cover_exactly_the_same_slot_set`
(`Tests/UI/test_console_runtime_ownership.py`) asserts set equality between
what `ChatScreen.console_view_hooks()` provides and what the slot list
declares — so the omission is caught, but only if that test runs.

**What to do.** When adding any kwargs entry to
`ChatScreen.console_view_hooks()`, add the matching `ConsoleViewHookSlot`
entry to `CONSOLE_VIEW_HOOK_SLOTS` in the same change, with a `why` naming
the production read site that makes the chosen `viewless_default` correct
(`None` only where the read site's own guard makes it inert or fail-closed;
an explicit callable everywhere else). Then run the slot-set test —
`.venv/bin/python -m pytest Tests/UI/test_console_runtime_ownership.py` —
before trusting any new hook wiring, however green its feature tests are:
they exercise the callable directly and never go through the bind.
