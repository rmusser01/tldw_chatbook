  - question: "Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast every morning and bakes 4 into muffins for her friends every day. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much does she make every day?"
    answer: "18"
    solution: "Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast and uses 4 for muffins, so she uses 3 + 4 = 7 eggs. This leaves 16 - 7 = 9 eggs to sell. At $2 per egg, she makes 9 Ã— $2 = $18 per day. #### 18"
