# Test Fixes Tracking Document

This document tracks all test fixes applied to the tldw_chatbook_dev project. It serves as an append-only log of changes, decisions, and outcomes.

**Created**: 2025-06-25  
**Purpose**: Track test fixes for Event_Handlers, Media_DB, and Notes modules

---

## Session 1: Initial Analysis and Planning
**Date**: 2025-06-25  
**Modules**: Event_Handlers, Media_DB, Notes  
**Initial State**: 71 test failures across three modules

### Findings Summary

#### Event_Handlers (21 failures)
- **Root Cause**: Async/sync mock mismatches
- **Key Issues**:
  - Methods mocked as AsyncMock when they should be MagicMock
  - Missing _chat_state_lock attribute
  - Incorrect widget lifecycle mocking

#### Media_DB (35 failures)
- **Root Cause**: DateTime objects not JSON serializable
- **Key Issues**:
  - SQLite returns datetime objects due to PARSE_DECLTYPES
  - _log_sync_event calls json.dumps on datetime-containing dicts
  - Affects all operations that trigger sync logging

#### Notes (15 failures)
- **Root Cause**: Missing database tables and outdated test assertions
- **Key Issues**:
  - sync_sessions table not created in V4→V5 migration
  - Test log messages don't match implementation
  - Database schema incomplete

### Fix Priority Order
1. Media_DB - Critical (blocks all sync functionality)
2. Notes - High (required for sync features)
3. Event_Handlers - Medium (UI functionality)

## Fix #1: Media_DB DateTime Serialization
**Date**: 2025-06-25  
**File**: tldw_chatbook/DB/Client_Media_DB_v2.py  
**Status**: Completed

### Changes to be made:
1. Add custom JSON encoder for datetime serialization
2. Update _log_sync_event method to use custom encoder
3. Consider adding helper function for consistent datetime handling

### Implementation Details:
**Changes Made**:
1. Added `DateTimeEncoder` class (lines 86-93) that extends `json.JSONEncoder`
2. The encoder converts datetime objects to ISO format strings
3. Updated `_log_sync_event` method (line 884) to use `cls=DateTimeEncoder`

**Code Added**:
```python
class DateTimeEncoder(json.JSONEncoder):
    """Custom JSON encoder that handles datetime objects."""
    def default(self, obj):
        if isinstance(obj, datetime):
            # Convert to ISO format string
            return obj.isoformat()
        return super().default(obj)
```

**Result**: JSON serialization now handles datetime objects by converting them to ISO format strings

## Fix #2: Notes Database Migration
**Date**: 2025-06-25  
**File**: tldw_chatbook/DB/ChaChaNotes_DB.py  
**Status**: Completed

### Changes to be made:
1. Update V4→V5 migration to include full SQL from migration file
2. Add sync_sessions and sync_conflicts table creation
3. Update schema version if needed

### Implementation Details:
**Changes Made**:
1. Updated `_MIGRATE_V4_TO_V5_SQL` (lines 882-952) to include complete migration
2. Added `sync_sessions` table creation with proper indexes
3. Added `sync_conflicts` table creation with proper indexes
4. Added missing index `idx_notes_sync_excluded`

**Tables Added**:
- `sync_sessions`: Tracks sync operations with session metadata
- `sync_conflicts`: Tracks unresolved sync conflicts

**Result**: The V4→V5 migration now creates all required tables for the sync functionality

### Implementation Details:
[To be filled when implementing]

## Fix #4-6: Event_Handlers Mock Setup
**Date**: 2025-06-25  
**Files**: Tests/Event_Handlers/Chat_Events/*.py  
**Status**: Completed

### Changes Made:

#### test_chat_events.py:
1. Added `_chat_state_lock` attribute to mock app
2. Added thread-safe methods `get_current_ai_message_widget` and `set_current_ai_message_widget` as synchronous mocks
3. Fixed chat log container to have async `mount` and `remove_children` methods

#### test_chat_streaming_events.py:
1. Added `_chat_state_lock` attribute to mock app
2. Changed widget mocks from AsyncMock to MagicMock (widgets are not async)
3. Added thread-safe methods as synchronous mocks
4. Added `call_from_thread` mock for proper thread handling

#### test_chat_events_sidebar.py:
1. Changed ListView and TextArea from AsyncMock to MagicMock
2. Added explicit `clear` and `append` methods as synchronous mocks

**Result**: Fixed async/sync mismatches that were causing AttributeError exceptions

---

## Fix #7: Notes Test Mock Assertions
**Date**: 2025-06-25  
**File**: Tests/Notes/test_notes_library_unit.py  
**Status**: Completed

### Changes Made:
1. Updated initialization test to expect "NotesInteropService: Ensured base directory exists:" log message
2. Updated close_user_connection test to expect "Closed and removed DB instance for user context" log message
3. Updated close_user_connection_not_exist test to expect "No active DB instance found in cache for user context" log message

**Result**: Test assertions now match actual implementation log messages

## Decisions Log

### Decision #1: DateTime Serialization Approach
**Date**: 2025-06-25  
**Options Considered**:
1. Custom JSON encoder class
2. Convert datetimes to strings before serialization
3. Change database to not parse datetimes

**Decision**: Custom JSON encoder (Option 1)  
**Rationale**: Least invasive, maintains type safety, reusable across codebase

---

## Notes for Future Maintenance
- Consider adding pre-commit hooks to run affected tests
- Database migrations should be tested with both fresh and existing databases
- Mock setup patterns should be documented for consistency

## Session 4: RAG Hanging Test Fix Implementation
**Date**: 2025-06-26  
**Purpose**: Fix the RAG hanging test issue with process-level timeout

### Issue Analysis
The `test_chunk_by_sentences_preserves_boundaries` test in `test_rag_properties.py` was hanging when NLTK's `sent_tokenize` function received certain property-based test inputs. The issue was:
- Hypothesis generates random text that can cause NLTK to hang
- No process-level timeout to kill hanging operations
- NLTK tokenizer doesn't handle certain character sequences well

### Fixes Implemented

#### 1. Added pytest-timeout Plugin
**File**: `pyproject.toml`
- Added `pytest-timeout` to dev dependencies
- Configured global timeout of 300 seconds
- Added timeout method as "thread" for cross-platform compatibility
- Added timeout marker to pytest markers

#### 2. Fixed Hanging Test
**File**: `Tests/RAG/test_rag_properties.py`
- Added `@pytest.mark.timeout(30)` decorator to the problematic test
- Test now times out gracefully after 30 seconds instead of hanging indefinitely

#### 3. Improved NLTK Operations Safety
**File**: `tldw_chatbook/RAG_Search/Services/chunking_service.py`
- Added `safe_nltk_tokenize` function with:
  - Input validation and character sanitization
  - Text length limiting (10,000 chars max)
  - Signal-based timeout for Unix systems (5 seconds)
  - Fallback to simple regex splitting on timeout/error
  - Removal of problematic control characters
- Updated `_chunk_by_sentences` to use safe tokenizer

#### 4. Updated Test Runners
**Files**: `Tests/RAG/run_tests.py`, `Tests/RAG/run_rag_tests.py`
- Added `-t/--timeout` command line argument (default: 60s)
- Test runners now pass timeout parameter to pytest
- Both standalone and integrated test runners support timeout

### Results
- The hanging test now completes successfully in ~0.18s
- NLTK operations are protected from hanging on edge cases
- Test infrastructure is more robust with configurable timeouts
- No loss of functionality - fallback methods ensure processing continues

### Technical Details
The fix uses a multi-layered approach:
1. **pytest-timeout** handles test-level timeouts
2. **Signal alarms** provide operation-level timeouts (Unix only)
3. **Input sanitization** prevents known problematic inputs
4. **Graceful degradation** ensures functionality continues with fallbacks

### Next Steps Completed
✅ Fixed RAG hanging test with process-level timeout

### Remaining Next Steps
1. Complete Textual widget test rewrite
2. Standardize datetime handling across all tests
3. Implement CI/CD with test gates
4. Separate unit/integration/e2e test categories
