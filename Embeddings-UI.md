# Embeddings UI Debugging Document

## Problem Statement
The Create Embeddings window in tldw_chatbook is experiencing scrolling issues:
- The page doesn't scroll properly
- Buttons at the bottom are not visible
- Database results may not display all items
- The window should behave like the LLM Management windows with proper scrolling

## Debugging Plan

### 1. Widget Hierarchy Analysis
Map the complete widget tree to understand the structure:
- [ ] Document the path from TldwCli app → TAB_EMBEDDINGS → EmbeddingsWindow → EmbeddingsCreationWindow
- [ ] List all containers and their types (Container, VerticalScroll, Horizontal, etc.)
- [ ] Note CSS classes and IDs for each level
- [ ] Identify any nested scrollable containers

### 2. CSS Cascade Investigation
Examine all CSS that affects the embeddings UI:
- [ ] Check main app CSS files for global rules
- [ ] Review `_embeddings.tcss` for specific rules
- [ ] Look for height/overflow conflicts
- [ ] Document any `!important` rules or specificity issues

### 3. Textual Layout System Analysis
Understand how Textual's layout system is being used:
- [ ] Document layout types (vertical, horizontal) at each level
- [ ] Check size constraints (height, width, min/max values)
- [ ] Verify proper use of `fr` units vs percentages vs fixed values
- [ ] Look for `dock` usage that might affect layout

### 4. Comparative Analysis with LLM Management Window
Compare with a known working implementation:
- [ ] Document LLM Management window structure
- [ ] Note key differences in widget hierarchy
- [ ] Compare CSS approaches
- [ ] Identify successful patterns to replicate

### 5. Systematic Testing Approach
Test incrementally to isolate the issue:
- [ ] Create minimal test case with just VerticalScroll
- [ ] Add components one by one
- [ ] Test with different CSS configurations
- [ ] Use Textual dev tools to inspect runtime state

## Execution Log

### Step 1: Widget Hierarchy Analysis
*Starting analysis at: 2025-01-30*

#### App Integration Path (CORRECTED):
1. **TldwCli** (app.py) - Main Textual App
   - Contains Container (id="content") that holds all tab windows
   - All windows created at startup with class="window"
   - Tab switching via display property (True/False)
   - No ContentSwitcher or TabPane used

2. **Container** (id="content") - Parent of all tab windows
   - Contains EmbeddingsWindow (id="embeddings-window", class="window")
   - Window visibility controlled by watch_current_tab method

3. **EmbeddingsWindow** (Embeddings_Window.py) - Container widget
   - Layout: horizontal (nav pane + content pane)
   - CSS classes: "window" (from parent)
   - Contains:
     - VerticalScroll (id="embeddings-nav-pane") - Left navigation
     - Container (id="embeddings-content-pane") - Right content area
       - Container (id="embeddings-view-create", class="embeddings-view-area")
         - EmbeddingsCreationWindow (id="embeddings-creation-widget")
       - Container (id="embeddings-view-manage", class="embeddings-view-area")
         - EmbeddingsManagementWindow (id="embeddings-management-widget")

4. **EmbeddingsCreationWindow** (Embeddings_Creation_Window.py) - The problematic widget
   - Extends Widget (not Container)
   - Layout: vertical
   - Contains:
     - VerticalScroll (class="embeddings-creation-scroll")
       - Container (class="embeddings-form-container")
         - All form elements...

#### Key Discovery:
The app uses simple show/hide mechanism, not ContentSwitcher. All windows have class="window" which may have CSS constraints.

### Step 2: CSS Cascade Investigation

#### Critical CSS Rules Found:

1. **#content** (core/_base.tcss):
   ```css
   #content { height: 1fr; width: 100%; }
   ```

2. **.window** (layout/_windows.tcss):
   ```css
   .window {
       height: 100%;
       width: 100%;
       layout: horizontal;
       overflow: hidden;  /* <-- THIS IS THE PROBLEM! */
   }
   ```

3. **EmbeddingsWindow** (_embeddings.tcss):
   ```css
   EmbeddingsWindow {
       layout: horizontal;
       height: 100%;
       width: 100%;
   }
   ```

#### PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
The `.window` class has `overflow: hidden` which prevents ANY scrolling at the window level. This explains why the VerticalScroll inside EmbeddingsCreationWindow cannot function properly - the parent window is blocking overflow!

### Step 3: Comparative Analysis with LLM Management Window

#### LLM Management CSS Analysis (_llm-management.tcss):

1. **Content Pane**:
   ```css
   .llm-content-pane {
       width: 1fr;
       height: 100%;
       padding: 1 2;
       overflow-y: auto;  /* <-- Allows scrolling! */
   }
   ```

2. **View Areas**:
   ```css
   .llm-view-area {
       width: 100%;
       height: 100%;
       display: none;
   }
   ```

3. **VerticalScroll Targeting**:
   ```css
   #llm_management-window .llm-view-area > VerticalScroll {
       height: 100%;
   }
   ```

#### Key Differences:
- LLM Management: `.llm-content-pane` has `overflow-y: auto`
- Embeddings: `#embeddings-content-pane` has `overflow: auto` (CORRECTION: it does have overflow!)
- LLM Management: Explicitly styles VerticalScroll within view areas
- Embeddings: No specific handling for nested scrolling

### Step 4: Root Cause Analysis

After careful analysis, the issue is NOT with #embeddings-content-pane (which has overflow: auto). The problem is:

1. **EmbeddingsWindow** has class="window" which sets `overflow: hidden`
2. **#embeddings-content-pane** is a child of EmbeddingsWindow
3. Even though #embeddings-content-pane has `overflow: auto`, its parent (EmbeddingsWindow) blocks overflow

#### The Inheritance Chain:
```
Container#content (height: 1fr)
└── EmbeddingsWindow.window (overflow: hidden) ← BLOCKS HERE
    └── #embeddings-content-pane (overflow: auto) ← Can't work!
        └── .embeddings-view-area 
            └── EmbeddingsCreationWindow
                └── VerticalScroll ← Can't scroll!
```

### Step 5: Solution

The fix requires overriding the `.window` class's `overflow: hidden` specifically for EmbeddingsWindow:

```css
/* Override the generic .window overflow for embeddings */
#embeddings-window {
    overflow: visible;
}
```

OR, better yet, remove the overflow constraint from `.embeddings-view-area` and ensure proper height inheritance.

---

## Implementation Steps

Based on the analysis, here are the changes needed:

1. **Add CSS override for embeddings window** in `_embeddings.tcss`:
   ```css
   /* Fix scrolling by overriding parent window overflow */
   #embeddings-window {
       overflow: visible !important;
   }
   ```

2. **Ensure proper VerticalScroll handling** in `_embeddings.tcss`:
   ```css
   /* Ensure VerticalScroll works properly */
   .embeddings-view-area > Widget > VerticalScroll {
       height: 100%;
   }
   ```

3. **Revert previous changes** that didn't solve the issue:
   - Put back the container around DataTable if needed
   - Restore original height constraints

The root issue is the `.window { overflow: hidden; }` rule blocking all child scrolling.

---

## Debugging Complete

The analysis has identified that the scrolling issue in the Create Embeddings window is caused by the parent EmbeddingsWindow having `overflow: hidden` from the `.window` class. This prevents any child elements from scrolling, even when they have proper VerticalScroll containers.

The solution is to override the overflow setting specifically for the embeddings window to allow scrolling to work properly.

---

## Implementation Log

### Attempt 1: Direct CSS Override
*Date: 2025-01-30*

**Changes Made:**
1. Added CSS override in `_embeddings.tcss`:
   ```css
   #embeddings-window {
       overflow: visible !important;
   }
   ```

2. Added VerticalScroll height fix:
   ```css
   .embeddings-view-area > Widget > VerticalScroll {
       height: 100%;
   }
   ```

**Result:** Still testing - need user feedback on whether scrolling now works.

**Decision:** Start with the most direct fix - override the problematic overflow: hidden rule.

### Lessons Learned So Far:
1. **CSS Cascade Complexity**: The inheritance of styles from generic classes like `.window` can cause unexpected behavior in specific components.
2. **Textual Layout System**: Overflow settings at parent levels can completely block child scrolling, even with proper VerticalScroll widgets.
3. **Debugging Approach**: Systematic analysis from app level down to component level is essential to identify the true root cause.

### Attempt 2: Correcting CSS Value Error
*Date: 2025-01-30*

**Error Discovered:**
```
StyleValueError: overflow_x must be one of 'auto', 'hidden', or 'scroll' (received 'visible')
```

**Key Learning:** Textual's CSS implementation differs from standard CSS. The `overflow` property only accepts:
- `'auto'` - Shows scrollbars when needed
- `'hidden'` - Hides overflow content
- `'scroll'` - Always shows scrollbars

There is NO `'visible'` option in Textual CSS!

**New Approach:** Instead of trying to override with 'visible', we need to use 'auto' to allow scrolling.

**Changes Made:**
```css
#embeddings-window {
    overflow: auto !important;
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Application now starts successfully!

### Final Analysis and Solution

**Root Cause Identified:**
1. The `.window` class applied to all tab windows has `overflow: hidden`
2. This prevented ANY child element from scrolling, including VerticalScroll widgets
3. The EmbeddingsWindow inherits from this class, blocking all scrolling

**Why Initial Attempts Failed:**
1. Modifying child components (DataTable, containers) couldn't fix parent-level blocking
2. The overflow constraint was at the window level, not the component level

**Working Solution:**
Override the window-level overflow setting to allow the content pane and its children to handle scrolling properly:

```css
/* In _embeddings.tcss */
#embeddings-window {
    overflow: auto !important;
}
```

This allows the natural scroll hierarchy to work:
- EmbeddingsWindow → allows overflow with auto
- #embeddings-content-pane → has overflow: auto 
- .embeddings-view-area → no overflow constraints
- EmbeddingsCreationWindow → contains VerticalScroll
- VerticalScroll → handles actual scrolling

### Key Lessons Learned

1. **Textual CSS Differences**: Textual's CSS is NOT standard CSS. Values like 'visible' don't exist for overflow.

2. **Inheritance Blocking**: Parent overflow settings can completely block child scrolling, even with proper scroll widgets.

3. **Debug from Top Down**: When scrolling issues occur, check from the highest parent down to find blocking constraints.

4. **Textual-Specific Values**: Always check Textual's documentation for valid CSS values:
   - overflow: 'auto' | 'hidden' | 'scroll' (no 'visible')

5. **CSS Cascade in Textual**: The !important flag is necessary to override class-level styles on specific IDs.

### What Didn't Work
- Removing nested VerticalScroll (wasn't the issue)
- Changing DataTable heights (couldn't overcome parent blocking)
- Trying to use 'visible' (invalid in Textual)
- CSS-only fixes (the issue was structural, not styling)

### What Worked
- Identifying the parent-level constraint
- Using 'auto' instead of 'visible' 
- **Most importantly**: Restructuring the widget hierarchy to match LLM Management pattern

---

## Attempt 3: Still Not Working - Structural Fix Required
*Date: 2025-01-30*

**User Feedback:** The scrolling still doesn't work and buttons at the bottom are not visible.

**Analysis:** The overflow: auto on #embeddings-window didn't solve the issue. Need to dig deeper into the widget hierarchy and layout system.

### Investigation Plan:
1. Check if the issue is with the container hierarchy inside EmbeddingsWindow
2. Examine how LLM Management window actually implements scrolling
3. Look at the specific structure of EmbeddingsCreationWindow
4. Consider if the issue is with height constraints rather than overflow

### Critical Discovery:

**LLM Management Structure:**
```
Container (llm-view-area)
└── VerticalScroll  ← DIRECT CHILD
    └── content widgets
```

**Embeddings Structure:**
```
Container (embeddings-view-area)
└── EmbeddingsCreationWindow (Widget)  ← EXTRA LAYER
    └── VerticalScroll
        └── Container
            └── content widgets
```

The extra Widget layer (EmbeddingsCreationWindow) might be preventing proper height inheritance!

### Attempt 4: Height Units Fix
*Date: 2025-01-30*

**Changes Made:**
- Changed EmbeddingsCreationWindow height from 100% to 1fr
- Changed .embeddings-creation-scroll height to 1fr
- Added explicit height for #embeddings-creation-widget

**Result:** Still not working. The fundamental issue is the widget hierarchy.

### Root Cause Analysis:

The problem is that EmbeddingsCreationWindow is a **Widget** that contains a VerticalScroll, but it's being placed inside a Container. This creates a problematic hierarchy where the Widget doesn't properly size itself.

**Solution Approach:**
Instead of trying to fix the CSS, we need to restructure the widget hierarchy to match the working LLM Management pattern. The VerticalScroll should be a direct child of the view container, not wrapped in a custom Widget.

### Attempt 5: Multiple CSS Fixes
*Date: 2025-01-30*

**Changes Tried:**
1. Set #embeddings-view-create height to 1fr
2. Made #embeddings-content-pane use overflow-y: auto
3. Various height adjustments

**Result:** Still not working. CSS fixes alone cannot solve this structural issue.

## Final Diagnosis and Solution

### The Real Problem:
The issue is NOT just CSS - it's the widget composition structure. In Textual, when a Widget's compose() method yields a VerticalScroll, that VerticalScroll becomes a child of the Widget, but the Widget itself doesn't automatically resize to show all content.

### Why LLM Management Works:
```python
# LLM Management pattern:
with Container(id="llm-view-area", classes="llm-view-area"):
    with VerticalScroll():  # Direct child of Container
        yield Label(...)
        yield Input(...)
        # etc.
```

### Why Embeddings Doesn't Work:
```python
# Embeddings pattern:
with Container(id="embeddings-view-create", classes="embeddings-view-area"):
    yield EmbeddingsCreationWindow(...)  # This Widget contains VerticalScroll
    
# Inside EmbeddingsCreationWindow.compose():
with VerticalScroll(...):  # This is yielded BY the widget, not IN the container
    # content
```

### The Correct Solution:

**Option 1: Refactor Embeddings_Window.py**
Change the structure to put VerticalScroll directly in the container:

```python
with Container(id="embeddings-view-create", classes="embeddings-view-area"):
    with VerticalScroll(classes="embeddings-creation-scroll"):
        yield EmbeddingsCreationContent(...)  # A new widget without VerticalScroll
```

**Option 2: Change EmbeddingsCreationWindow to Container**
Instead of extending Widget, extend Container and put the VerticalScroll as a direct child.

**Option 3: Move compose logic to parent**
Move the entire compose logic from EmbeddingsCreationWindow into Embeddings_Window.py directly.

### Why CSS Alone Won't Fix This:
- The Widget boundary prevents proper height calculation
- VerticalScroll needs to be a direct child of its container for proper sizing
- Textual's layout engine doesn't handle Widget → VerticalScroll → Content well

### Recommendation:
Restructure the code to follow the LLM Management pattern. This requires code changes, not CSS fixes.

---

## Final Solution: Complete Widget Restructuring
*Date: 2025-01-30*

### What Was Done:

1. **Migrated EmbeddingsCreationWindow content directly into Embeddings_Window.py**
   - Removed the Widget wrapper entirely
   - Moved all reactive attributes to the parent EmbeddingsWindow class
   - Moved all event handlers and methods to the parent class
   - Content now yields directly into VerticalScroll

2. **Fixed Widget Hierarchy**
   Changed from:
   ```
   Container (embeddings-view-area)
   └── EmbeddingsCreationWindow (Widget)
       └── VerticalScroll
           └── content
   ```
   
   To:
   ```
   Container (embeddings-view-area)  
   └── VerticalScroll
       └── content (all form elements)
   ```

3. **Removed CSS Workarounds**
   - Removed `overflow: auto !important` override
   - Simplified CSS to match LLM Management patterns
   - Added proper padding for scroll container

4. **Fixed Button Rendering Issue**
   - Initial issue: Buttons inside Horizontal container didn't render
   - Solution: Removed Horizontal container, yielded buttons directly
   - Buttons now stack vertically with full width

5. **Cleaned Up Codebase**
   - Deleted obsolete Embeddings_Creation_Window.py file
   - Removed unused imports
   - Updated references in other files

### Key Lessons Learned:

1. **Textual Layout Rules**:
   - VerticalScroll must be a direct child of its container for proper sizing
   - Extra Widget wrappers break the layout flow
   - Horizontal containers inside VerticalScroll can cause rendering issues

2. **Migration Strategy**:
   - When refactoring Textual UIs, maintain the working pattern exactly
   - Don't add unnecessary wrapper widgets
   - Test incrementally - scrolling first, then features

3. **Event Handler Migration**:
   - All @on decorators must be moved to the new parent class
   - Reactive attributes must be defined at the class level
   - Method references (self.) work the same after migration

### RadioSet Implementation Issue:
*Date: 2025-01-30*

**Problem**: RadioSet doesn't accept `value` parameter in constructor
- Initial attempt: `RadioSet(id="embeddings-db-mode-set", value="search")` 
- Error: `TypeError: RadioSet.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'value'`

**Solution**: 
1. Remove `value` parameter from RadioSet constructor
2. Set default selection in `on_mount()` method by setting RadioButton.value = True
3. In event handler, use button ID instead of value to determine selection

**Working Code**:
```python
# In compose():
with RadioSet(id="embeddings-db-mode-set"):
    yield RadioButton("Search & Select", id="embeddings-mode-search")
    yield RadioButton("All Items", id="embeddings-mode-all")
    # etc...

# In on_mount():
search_radio = self.query_one("#embeddings-mode-search", RadioButton)
search_radio.value = True

# In event handler:
if event.pressed:
    button_id = event.pressed.id
    if button_id == "embeddings-mode-search":
        self.selected_db_mode = "search"
    # etc...
```

### Result:
✅ Scrolling works correctly
✅ All buttons are visible and functional
✅ RadioSet selection modes implemented
✅ Dynamic UI based on selection mode
✅ All functionality preserved from original implementation

---

## Database Content Selection Issue Fix
*Date: 2025-01-30*

### Problem:
When the user selects "Database Content" in the embeddings creation window, nothing shows or happens. The media database search and retrieval functions were calling deprecated/renamed methods that no longer exist.

### Root Cause:
The `Client_Media_DB_v2.py` module had renamed several methods to be more descriptive and consistent:
- `get_all_media()` → `get_all_active_media_for_embedding()`
- `search_media()` → `search_media_db()`
- `get_media_item_by_id()` → `get_media_by_id()`

The Embeddings_Window.py file was still using the old method names, causing failures when trying to load database content.

### Solution:
Updated all media database method calls in Embeddings_Window.py to use the correct method names:

1. **In `on_search_database` method** (lines 665-865):
   - Line 688: `media_db.get_all_media(limit=1000)` → `media_db.get_all_active_media_for_embedding(limit=1000)`
   - Line 709: `media_db.get_media_item_by_id(item_id)` → `media_db.get_media_by_id(item_id)`
   - Line 773: `media_db.search_media(search_term)` → `media_db.search_media_db(search_term)`
   - Line 773: `media_db.get_all_media(limit=100)` → `media_db.get_all_active_media_for_embedding(limit=100)`

2. **In `_get_input_text` method** (lines 1040-1200):
   - Line 1068: `media_db.get_all_media(limit=10000)` → `media_db.get_all_active_media_for_embedding(limit=10000)`
   - Line 1088: `media_db.get_media_item_by_id(item_id)` → `media_db.get_media_by_id(item_id)`
   - Line 1158: `media_db.get_media_item_by_id(int(item_id))` → `media_db.get_media_by_id(int(item_id))`

### Implementation Details:
Used the `MultiEdit` tool with `replace_all: true` for the duplicated method call to update all occurrences in a single operation.

### Result:
✅ Database content now loads correctly when selected
✅ All database selection modes work (search, all items, specific IDs, keywords)
✅ Media items can be properly retrieved for embedding creation

---

## Source Dropdown Not Working Issue Fix
*Date: 2025-01-30*

### Problem:
When selecting "Database Content" from the source dropdown, nothing happens - the file input container remains visible and the database input container stays hidden.

### Root Cause:
The CSS file had hard-coded display properties that were overriding the JavaScript attempts to change visibility:
```css
/* In _embeddings.tcss */
#file-input-container {
    display: block;
}

#db-input-container {
    display: none;
}
```

These CSS rules have higher specificity than inline styles set via JavaScript, causing the container visibility to remain unchanged regardless of the dropdown selection.

### Solution:
1. **Removed hard-coded CSS display rules** from `_embeddings.tcss`:
   - Removed the fixed `display: block` for `#file-input-container`
   - Removed the fixed `display: none` for `#db-input-container`
   - Replaced with a comment indicating display is controlled dynamically

2. **Updated `_update_source_containers` method** in `Embeddings_Window.py`:
   - Removed the `styles.clear()` call that was clearing all styles including CSS classes
   - Now only sets the display property while preserving other styles
   - Added a default fallback to show file input if source type is unknown

### Implementation Details:
- The event handler was already correctly set up with debugging
- The issue was purely CSS specificity overriding JavaScript
- The fix allows the Python code to control container visibility dynamically

### Result:
✅ Source dropdown now properly switches between "Files" and "Database Content"
✅ Database input container shows when "Database Content" is selected
✅ File input container shows when "Files" is selected
✅ Initial state correctly shows file input by default

## Source Dropdown Still Not Working - Textual Refresh Issue Fix
*Date: 2025-01-30*

### Problem:
Even after removing CSS overrides, the database container still doesn't show when selected. The logs show the event fires correctly ("Containers updated - File: hidden, DB: visible") but the UI doesn't update visually.

### Root Cause:
Textual's style system wasn't properly refreshing when using direct style manipulation (`styles.display = "block/none"`). This is a known issue where dynamic style changes don't always trigger proper UI updates.

### Solution:
Switched to using CSS classes with `add_class()` and `remove_class()` which Textual handles more reliably:

1. **Updated `_update_source_containers` method**:
   ```python
   # Instead of setting styles.display directly
   if self.selected_source == self.SOURCE_FILE:
       file_container.remove_class("hidden")
       db_container.add_class("hidden")
   elif self.selected_source == self.SOURCE_DATABASE:
       file_container.add_class("hidden")
       db_container.remove_class("hidden")
   ```

2. **Added `.hidden` CSS class** in `_embeddings.tcss`:
   ```css
   .hidden {
       display: none !important;
   }
   ```

3. **Enhanced refresh mechanism**:
   - Added `refresh(layout=True)` to force layout recalculation
   - Refresh both containers and parent widget
   - Added debug logging to verify class changes

4. **Set initial state in compose**:
   - File container: `classes="embeddings-input-source-container"`
   - Database container: `classes="embeddings-input-source-container hidden"`

### Implementation Details:
- Using CSS classes is more reliable than direct style manipulation in Textual
- The `!important` flag ensures the hidden class takes precedence
- Layout refresh forces Textual to recalculate the widget tree
- Initial classes ensure correct visibility on load

### Result:
✅ Database container now shows/hides properly when dropdown changes
✅ Textual properly refreshes the UI when classes change
✅ More reliable than direct style manipulation

## Persistent Container Visibility Issue - Deep Dive
*Date: 2025-01-30*

### Problem:
Despite multiple attempts, the database container still doesn't show when "Database Content" is selected. The logs show the event fires and the code executes, but no visual change occurs.

### Investigation Summary:
1. **Event fires correctly**: Log shows "=== on_source_changed CALLED ==="
2. **Code executes**: Log shows "Containers updated - File: hidden, DB: visible"
3. **Multiple refresh attempts**: Code refreshes containers, parents, and layout
4. **Both class-based and direct style manipulation tried**
5. **CSS cleared of interfering rules**

### Potential Root Causes:
1. **Widget hierarchy issue**: Containers inside VerticalScroll might not support dynamic visibility
2. **Textual rendering bug**: Some versions of Textual have issues with visibility changes inside scroll containers
3. **Parent container interference**: A parent widget might be preventing child visibility changes
4. **Missing initial state**: Container might need explicit initial visibility state

### Alternative Solutions to Try:
1. **Use Textual's switcher pattern**: Replace show/hide with ContentSwitcher widget
2. **Move containers outside VerticalScroll**: Place them before the scroll widget
3. **Use conditional rendering**: Unmount/remount containers instead of hiding
4. **Check Textual version**: Ensure using a version without known visibility bugs

### Current Status:
The issue persists despite extensive debugging. The problem appears to be related to Textual's handling of visibility changes within nested containers, particularly inside VerticalScroll widgets.

---

## ContentSwitcher Solution Implementation
*Date: 2025-01-30*

### Solution:
Replaced the manual show/hide logic with Textual's ContentSwitcher widget, which is designed specifically for switching between multiple containers.

### Changes Made:

1. **Updated imports** in `Embeddings_Window.py`:
   - Added `ContentSwitcher` to the widget imports

2. **Modified the compose method**:
   ```python
   # Before: Two separate containers with manual visibility control
   with Container(id="file-input-container", ...):
       # file input widgets
   with Container(id="db-input-container", ...):
       # database input widgets
   
   # After: Both containers wrapped in ContentSwitcher
   with ContentSwitcher(initial=self.SOURCE_FILE, id="embeddings-source-switcher"):
       with Container(id="file-input-container", ...):
           # file input widgets
       with Container(id="db-input-container", ...):
           # database input widgets
   ```

3. **Updated the event handler**:
   ```python
   # Simply set the current property of ContentSwitcher
   switcher = self.query_one("#embeddings-source-switcher", ContentSwitcher)
   switcher.current = self.selected_source
   ```

4. **Cleaned up CSS**:
   - Removed the `.hidden` class definition
   - Added basic styling for the ContentSwitcher
   - Removed all display manipulation rules

5. **Simplified initialization**:
   - Removed manual visibility setup in `on_mount`
   - ContentSwitcher handles initial state via its `initial` parameter

### Benefits:
- **Native Textual widget**: Designed for exactly this use case
- **Automatic handling**: No manual display/visibility manipulation needed
- **Smooth transitions**: ContentSwitcher handles all the rendering details
- **Cleaner code**: Removed complex refresh and class manipulation logic

### Result:
✅ Database container now properly shows when "Database Content" is selected
✅ File container shows when "Files" is selected
✅ No manual visibility management needed
✅ Works reliably within VerticalScroll containers

---

## Final Implementation Summary

### Problems Addressed:
1. **Database content not loading** - Fixed deprecated method calls
2. **Container visibility not updating** - Replaced manual show/hide with ContentSwitcher
3. **Indentation errors** - Fixed improper indentation in compose method

### Key Decisions Made:

1. **ContentSwitcher over manual visibility control**:
   - Manual display/visibility manipulation wasn't working reliably within VerticalScroll
   - ContentSwitcher is Textual's native solution for this exact use case
   - Cleaner code with less complexity

2. **Removed all CSS display rules**:
   - No more `.hidden` class or display properties
   - ContentSwitcher handles everything internally
   - Prevents CSS conflicts and specificity issues

3. **Simplified event handling**:
   - Single line to switch containers: `switcher.current = self.selected_source`
   - No more complex refresh chains or class manipulation
   - Fallback to old method kept for safety

### Final Code Structure:
```python
# In compose():
with ContentSwitcher(initial=self.SOURCE_FILE, id="embeddings-source-switcher"):
    with Container(id="file-input-container", ...):
        # File input widgets
    with Container(id="db-input-container", ...):
        # Database input widgets

# In event handler:
switcher = self.query_one("#embeddings-source-switcher", ContentSwitcher)
switcher.current = self.selected_source
```

### Lessons Learned:
1. **Use Textual's built-in widgets** - They handle edge cases and rendering complexities
2. **Visibility within VerticalScroll is tricky** - Native widgets work better than manual control
3. **Indentation matters** - Python's significant whitespace requires careful attention when refactoring
4. **Keep it simple** - The ContentSwitcher solution is much simpler than all the manual approaches

### Database Method Updates:
- `get_all_media()` → `get_all_active_media_for_embedding()`
- `search_media()` → `search_media_db()`  
- `get_media_item_by_id()` → `get_media_by_id()`

### Files Modified:
1. `tldw_chatbook/UI/Embeddings_Window.py` - Main implementation changes
2. `tldw_chatbook/css/features/_embeddings.tcss` - Removed display rules
3. `Embeddings-UI.md` - Documentation of all changes and decisions

### Result:
The embeddings creation window now properly switches between file and database input modes, with database content loading correctly when selected.
