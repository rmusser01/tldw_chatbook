# Tool Calling Implementation Summary

**Date**: 2025-07-16
**Author**: Claude Code

## Overview

This document summarizes the complete implementation of tool calling functionality in tldw_chatbook. Tool calling is now fully functional for both streaming and non-streaming responses.

## Changes Made

### 1. Streaming Response Handler (`chat_streaming_events.py`)

**File**: `tldw_chatbook/Event_Handlers/Chat_Events/chat_streaming_events.py`

**Changes**:
- Added imports for `get_tool_executor` and `ToolExecutionWidget`
- Replaced TODO at line 158 with full tool execution implementation
- Added `_continue_conversation_with_tools` function to handle conversation continuation
- Tool calls are now:
  - Detected from `event.response_data`
  - Executed asynchronously using `ToolExecutor`
  - Displayed using `ToolExecutionWidget`
  - Saved to database with `role='tool'`
  - Used to continue the conversation automatically

### 2. Non-Streaming Response Handler (`worker_events.py`)

**File**: `tldw_chatbook/Event_Handlers/worker_events.py`

**Changes**:
- Added imports for tool-related components
- Updated `StreamDone` class to include `response_data` parameter
- Added tool detection after non-streaming response processing (line 319)
- Added tool call accumulation in streaming chunks
- Tool calls in non-streaming are handled identically to streaming

### 3. Database Integration

- Tool messages are saved with `sender='tool'` which maps to `role='tool'` in the database
- Both tool calls and results are stored as separate messages
- Messages are formatted as JSON for clarity

### 4. Conversation Continuation

The `_continue_conversation_with_tools` function:
- Formats tool results as a new user message
- Automatically populates the chat input
- Triggers the send button to continue the conversation
- Handles both TAB_CHAT and TAB_CCP tabs

## How It Works

### For Users

1. User sends a message that triggers tool use (e.g., "What's 42 * 3.14159?")
2. LLM responds and includes tool calls in its response
3. Tools are automatically executed (calculator, datetime, etc.)
4. Results are displayed in a special tool widget with yellow/green borders
5. Conversation automatically continues with the tool results
6. LLM provides final answer using the tool results

### For Developers

1. **Tool Detection**: `parse_tool_calls_from_response()` handles multiple provider formats
2. **Tool Execution**: `ToolExecutor` manages safe execution with timeouts
3. **UI Display**: `ToolExecutionWidget` shows calls and results
4. **Database**: Messages saved with proper roles for conversation history
5. **Continuation**: Automatic flow maintains conversation context

## Available Tools

Currently, two built-in tools are available:
1. **calculator**: Safe mathematical expression evaluation
2. **get_current_datetime**: Current date/time with timezone support

## Adding New Tools

To add a new tool:

1. Create a class extending `Tool` in `tldw_chatbook/Tools/`
2. Implement required properties and `execute()` method
3. Register in `get_tool_executor()` function
4. Tool will automatically be available in all conversations

Example:
```python
class WeatherTool(Tool):
    @property
    def name(self) -> str:
        return "get_weather"
    
    @property
    def description(self) -> str:
        return "Get current weather for a location"
    
    @property
    def parameters(self) -> dict:
        return {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "location": {"type": "string", "description": "City name"}
            },
            "required": ["location"]
        }
    
    async def execute(self, **kwargs) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        location = kwargs.get("location")
        # Implementation here
        return {"temperature": 72, "condition": "sunny"}
```

## Testing

The implementation includes:
- Error handling for tool execution failures
- Timeout protection (30 seconds per tool)
- Concurrent execution support (up to 4 tools)
- Graceful fallbacks if UI elements are missing

## Future Enhancements

1. **Tool Settings UI**: Add interface for enabling/disabling tools
2. **More Built-in Tools**: Web search, file operations, RAG search
3. **Tool Permissions**: User-level access control
4. **Custom Tool Builder**: GUI for creating new tools
5. **Tool Result Caching**: Avoid redundant executions

## Conclusion

Tool calling is now fully functional in tldw_chatbook. The implementation maintains the existing architecture while adding powerful new capabilities. Users can now interact with LLMs that can perform calculations, check the time, and execute other tools to provide more accurate and useful responses.
