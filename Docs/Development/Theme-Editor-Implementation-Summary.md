## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **ThemeEditorView**: Main container extending Container
- **Reactive attributes**: current_theme_name, current_theme_data, is_modified, is_dark_theme
- **Event handlers**: Tree selection, color input changes, button actions
- **Integration**: Loaded as a view in ToolsSettingsWindow's ContentSwitcher

### Color System
- Uses Textual's Color.parse() for validation
- Supports hex colors (#RRGGBB format)
- Live preview updates via CSS style changes

### Theme Registration
- Uses `app.register_theme()` for runtime theme registration
- Applies with `app.theme = theme_name`
- Leverages existing `create_theme_from_dict()` helper

## Usage

1. Navigate to Settings tab (Ctrl+S or click gear icon)
2. Click "Theme Editor" in left navigation
3. Select a theme from the tree or create new
4. Modify colors using hex values
5. Preview changes in real-time
6. Save theme for persistence
7. Apply theme to current session

## Future Considerations

1. **Performance**: Consider lazy loading for large theme libraries
2. **Sharing**: Create community theme repository
3. **Templates**: Provide theme templates (Material, Solarized, etc.)
4. **AI Integration**: Generate themes based on image/mood
5. **Responsive**: Adapt theme based on terminal capabilities
