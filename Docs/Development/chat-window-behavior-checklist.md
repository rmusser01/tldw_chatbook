# ChatWindowEnhanced Behavior Checklist

## Purpose
This document captures all current behaviors of ChatWindowEnhanced that must be preserved during architectural refactoring. Use this as a manual test checklist before and after refactoring.

## Core Message Flow

### Sending Messages
- [ ] User can type text in chat input area (TextArea with ID "chat-input")
- [ ] Send button shows "Send" icon when not streaming
- [ ] Pressing Send button sends the message
- [ ] Enter key sends message (if configured)
- [ ] Chat input clears after sending
- [ ] Message appears in chat log
- [ ] Send button changes to "Stop" during streaming
- [ ] Stop button actually stops generation when clicked
- [ ] Button returns to "Send" after streaming completes
- [ ] Button click debouncing (300ms) prevents rapid duplicate sends

## Error Handling

### User-Facing Errors
- [ ] File not found shows notification
- [ ] Permission denied shows notification
- [ ] Invalid file type shows notification
- [ ] Network errors show notification
- [ ] All errors show appropriate severity (info/warning/error)

### Recovery
- [ ] UI remains responsive after errors
- [ ] Buttons return to correct state after errors
- [ ] Attachments cleared on file errors
- [ ] Voice recording stops cleanly on error

## Performance

### Responsiveness
- [ ] No lag when typing in chat input
- [ ] File picker opens immediately
- [ ] Buttons respond immediately to clicks
- [ ] No UI freezing during file processing
- [ ] Smooth scrolling in chat log

### Large Files
- [ ] Large text files process without freezing UI
- [ ] Progress indication for long operations (if implemented)
- [ ] Can cancel long-running operations (if implemented)

## Configuration

### Settings Respected
- [ ] `show_attach_button` - Controls attach button visibility
- [ ] `show_mic_button` - Controls mic button visibility
- [ ] `enable_tabs` - Controls tab container vs single session
- [ ] Theme variables applied correctly
- [ ] Custom CSS classes work

## State Management

### Reactive Properties
- [ ] `is_send_button` - Updates button label/tooltip/style
- [ ] `pending_image` - Triggers attachment UI updates
- [ ] Watchers fire correctly on state changes

### Persistence
- [ ] Conversation state preserved during session
- [ ] Attachments cleared appropriately
- [ ] Character selection persists

## Edge Cases

### Rapid Actions
- [ ] Rapid send/stop clicking handled (debounced)
- [ ] Can't send while already sending
- [ ] Can't start recording while recording
- [ ] Double-click attach doesn't open two pickers

### Missing Elements
- [ ] Handles missing widgets gracefully
- [ ] Works without optional features
- [ ] Degrades gracefully with missing dependencies

### Concurrent Operations
- [ ] Can type while file processing
- [ ] Can't attach during send
- [ ] Workers marked exclusive prevent conflicts

## Visual Indicators

### Loading States
- [ ] Send button disabled during send
- [ ] Stop button shows during streaming
- [ ] Attachment indicator visible when file attached

### Status Feedback
- [ ] Notifications appear for important events
- [ ] Errors shown with appropriate styling
- [ ] Success messages confirm actions

## Manual Test Procedure

### Basic Flow Test (5 min)
1. Start application
2. Send a text message
3. Verify message appears
4. Attach an image file
5. Verify indicator shows
6. Send message with attachment
7. Verify attachment clears
8. Start voice recording
9. Speak test phrase
10. Verify transcription appears
11. Send voice message
12. Toggle sidebars
13. Test keyboard shortcuts

### Error Test (3 min)
1. Try to attach non-existent file
2. Try to attach file without permissions
3. Start/stop recording rapidly
4. Send empty message
5. Click stop when not streaming

### Performance Test (2 min)
1. Type long message quickly
2. Attach large text file
3. Scroll through long chat history
4. Toggle sidebars rapidly
5. Switch tabs (if enabled)

## Widget Caching & Performance

### Widget References
- [ ] Widgets cached on mount for performance
- [ ] Cache includes: send button, chat input, mic button, attach button, etc.
- [ ] Cached references used instead of repeated queries
- [ ] NoMatches exceptions handled gracefully
- [ ] Cache updated if widgets recreated

### Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Batch DOM updates used where applicable
- [ ] Workers prevent UI blocking for file processing
- [ ] Reactive properties minimize recomposition
- [ ] CSS extracted to external files

## Button Routing

### Button Handler Logic
- [ ] Core buttons handled (send, stop, etc.)
- [ ] Sidebar toggle buttons work
- [ ] Attachment buttons functional (attach, clear)
- [ ] Notes expand button toggles size
- [ ] Unknown button IDs logged but don't crash
- [ ] Button handlers return proper stop/continue signals

## Reactive Properties

### State Management
- [ ] `is_send_button` reactive updates button label/icon
- [ ] `pending_image` reactive triggers attachment UI
- [ ] Watchers fire on state changes
- [ ] No duplicate state (reactive vs instance variables)
- [ ] Reactive properties don't conflict

## Worker Operations

### Background Processing
- [ ] File processing uses thread workers
- [ ] Workers are synchronous (not async)
- [ ] Workers marked exclusive to prevent conflicts
- [ ] Worker cancellation handled gracefully
- [ ] UI updates via call_from_thread
- [ ] Progress feedback during long operations

## Notes for Refactoring

### Must Preserve
- All user-facing behaviors above
- Public API (methods other components rely on)
- Event handling signatures
- Configuration keys
- Worker patterns (sync with @work(thread=True))

### Can Change
- Internal method organization
- Private method names
- File structure
- Internal state management
- Class hierarchy (as long as public API preserved)

### Risk Areas
- Widget caching - ensure cached refs updated if widgets recreated
- Worker threads - must remain synchronous
- Event bubbling - ensure proper propagation
- Tab support - complex interaction with sessions
- Reactive properties - avoid reading during compose()
