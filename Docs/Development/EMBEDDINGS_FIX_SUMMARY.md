# Embeddings Download Button Fix Summary

## Issue
The "Download Model" button in the Embeddings Management window was generating an "Unhandled button press" warning because button events were bubbling up to the app level instead of being handled by the widget.

## Root Cause
1. The `EmbeddingsManagementWindow` widget had proper `@on` decorators for button handlers
2. However, these handlers weren't stopping event propagation with `event.stop()`
3. Missing import for `EmbeddingConfigSchema` in `embeddings_events.py`

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated Button Handlers in `Embeddings_Management_Window.py`
- Added `event: Button.Pressed` parameter to all button handlers
- Added `event.stop()` to prevent event propagation
- Made handlers async where needed

Updated handlers:
- `on_download_model` - Downloads embedding models
- `on_load_model` - Loads models into memory
- `on_test_generate` - Generates test embeddings
- `on_unload_model` - Unloads models from memory
- `on_delete_model` - Deletes model files
- `on_toggle_pane` - Toggles left pane visibility
- `on_refresh_lists` - Refreshes model/collection lists

### 2. Fixed Import in `embeddings_events.py`
- Added missing import: `from ..Embeddings.Embeddings_Lib import EmbeddingFactory, EmbeddingConfigSchema`
- Added fallback: `EmbeddingConfigSchema = None` when dependencies aren't available

## Result
Button events are now properly handled at the widget level and won't generate "Unhandled button press" warnings at the app level.

## Testing
To verify the fix works:
1. Navigate to the Embeddings tab
2. Click "Manage Embeddings" 
3. Select a model from the list
4. Click "Download" - should no longer see the warning in logs
