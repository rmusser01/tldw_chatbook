## Implementation Notes

### Web Scraping Pipeline Design
```python
# Base architecture established
BaseScrapingPipeline (abstract)
├── FeedScrapingPipeline (RSS/Atom - existing)
├── RedditScrapingPipeline (new)
├── GenericWebScrapingPipeline (new)
└── CustomScrapingPipeline (new)

# Each pipeline must implement:
- fetch_content() - Get raw content
- parse_content() - Extract structured data
- validate_config() - Ensure configuration is valid
- get_rate_limit() - Return rate limit requirements
```

### Baseline Management Design
```python
# Change detection levels
1. Content Hash - Quick exact match
2. Structural Hash - HTML structure changes
3. Semantic Similarity - Meaning changes
4. Token Count - Length changes

# Storage strategy
- Keep full baseline for 30 days
- Store compressed diff for older changes
- Configurable retention per subscription
```

### Aggregation Engine Design
```python
# Token allocation strategy
1. Calculate total available tokens
2. Reserve tokens for:
   - Executive summary (10%)
   - Section headers (5%)
   - Transitions (5%)
3. Allocate remaining by priority:
   - High priority: 50%
   - Medium priority: 35%
   - Low priority: 15%
4. Recursive summarization for overflow
```

### Briefing Template Design
```python
# Template architecture
BriefingTemplate

│   ├── token_allocation: int
│   ├── priority: str
│   ├── required: bool
│   └── template: str (Jinja2)
└── total_tokens: int

# Built-in templates
1. Executive Summary - High-level overview for decision makers
