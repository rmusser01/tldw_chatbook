# Multiple Response Variants Implementation Progress

## Completed Tasks

### 1. ✅ Database Migration (V11 to V12)
- Added variant tracking columns to messages table:
  - `variant_of`: Links to original message ID
  - `variant_number`: Position in variant list (1, 2, 3...)
  - `is_selected_variant`: Boolean flag for selected variant
  - `total_variants`: Total count of variants
- Created helper methods:
  - `create_message_variant()`
  - `get_message_variants()`
  - `select_message_variant()`

### 2. ✅ Fixed Regenerate Handler
- Modified to create variants instead of removing messages
- Original message is kept and hidden
- New response becomes a variant with updated UI
- Both widgets get variant navigation UI

### 3. ✅ Added Variant Navigation UI
- Added Previous/Next buttons to ChatMessageEnhanced
- Shows "Response X of Y" indicator
- "Use This" button for non-selected variants
- Dynamic button state updates

### 4. ✅ Created Event Handlers
- `prev-variant` and `next-variant` navigation handlers
- `select-variant` for choosing active variant
- Updates database and UI state
- Handles boundary conditions

### 5. ✅ Updated Conversation Loading
- Modified `display_conversation_in_chat_tab_ui()`
- Skips non-selected variants when loading
- Passes variant fields to widgets
- Respects custom usernames/character names

## Current Issue: llm_n Parameter

The `llm_n` parameter is fully plumbed through the system:
1. UI has the input field (`#chat-llm-n`)
2. Event handlers retrieve and pass it
3. `chat_api_call` accepts it
4. OpenAI handler adds it to payload (line 274-275 of LLM_API_Calls.py)

**BUT**: When n > 1, OpenAI returns multiple choices like:
```json
{
  "choices": [
    {"index": 0, "message": {"content": "Response 1"}, ...},
    {"index": 1, "message": {"content": "Response 2"}, ...}
  ]
}
```

Current code only extracts the first choice. We need to:
1. Detect when multiple choices are returned
2. Create message variants for each choice
3. Display them with variant navigation

## Next Steps

### Implement Multiple Response Handling
Need to modify the response processing to:
1. Check if response has multiple choices
2. Create variants for each choice
3. Set first as selected, others as alternatives

### Add Cost Warning
When llm_n > 1, show warning about multiplied costs

### Test with Different Providers
Ensure variant system works with all supported LLMs

### Create Conversation Tree Widget
