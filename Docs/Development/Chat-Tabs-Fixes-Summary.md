## Summary of Changes

### 1. Replaced Dangerous Monkey Patching ✅

**Original Issue**: Runtime modification of core Textual framework methods (`app.query_one` and `app.query`)

**Solution Implemented**:
- Created `TabContext` class in `tldw_chatbook/Chat/tabs/tab_context.py`
- Uses dependency injection pattern for widget resolution
- Provides clean abstraction without modifying framework methods
- Includes widget caching for performance
- Maintains lists of tab-specific and global widgets

**Key Benefits**:
- No more runtime framework modification
- Type-safe widget queries
- Better debugging capabilities
- Improved performance with caching

### 2. Implemented Thread-Safe State Management ✅

**Original Issue**: Race conditions with `_current_chat_tab_id` being modified by multiple workers

**Solution Implemented**:
- Created `TabStateManager` class in `tldw_chatbook/Chat/tabs/tab_state_manager.py`
- Uses `threading.local()` for thread-safe storage
- Implements async locks for critical sections
- Provides context manager for tab operations
- Singleton pattern ensures global state consistency

**Key Features**:
- Thread-safe tab state tracking
- Async context manager for operations
- Worker-to-tab mapping
- Bulk operations support

### 3. Fixed Memory Leaks ✅

**Original Issue**: Hidden tabs continue running timers and holding resources

**Solution Implemented**:

#### In `chat_session.py`:
- Added lifecycle management methods: `suspend()`, `resume()`, `cleanup()`
- Timers are stopped when tabs become inactive
- Workers are cancelled during suspension
- Resources are cleaned up on tab close
- Comprehensive error handling in all lifecycle methods

#### In `chat_tab_container.py`:
- Integrated lifecycle management into tab switching
- Calls `suspend()` when switching away from a tab
- Calls `resume()` when switching to a tab
- Calls `cleanup()` before removing a tab
- Proper async implementation with error recovery

**Memory Management Features**:
- No more orphaned timers
- Worker cleanup on tab suspend
- Heavy data cleared on cleanup
- Proper widget reference management

### 4. Fixed Logic Bug in Exception Handling ✅

**Original Issue**: Flawed condition check `if 'original_query' in locals()`

**Solution Implemented**:
- Removed unnecessary condition check
- Proper try/finally pattern ensures cleanup always happens
- Fixed in all three handler functions

### 5. Implemented Unsaved Changes Protection ✅

**Original Issue**: No confirmation dialog for unsaved changes

**Solution Implemented**:
- Created `ConfirmationDialog` and `UnsavedChangesDialog` in `confirmation_dialog.py`
- Modal dialog with proper styling
- Integrated into `close_tab()` method
- Tracks unsaved changes in `ChatSessionData`
- Callbacks for confirm/cancel actions

**Features**:
- Professional modal dialog UI
- Clear warning message
- Proper async handling
- User-friendly button labels

### 6. Eliminated Code Duplication ✅

**Original Issue**: Repeated tab-aware query functions

**Solution Implemented**:
- All tab-aware query logic consolidated in `TabContext` class
- Event handlers now use `TabContext` consistently
- Removed duplicate functions
- Clean, DRY implementation

### 7. Added Comprehensive Error Handling ✅

**Original Issue**: Silent exception swallowing and poor error recovery

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added try/except blocks with specific error handling
- Proper logging at appropriate levels (debug, warning, error)
- User-friendly error notifications
- Graceful degradation on errors
- Recovery strategies for critical operations

**Error Handling Patterns**:
- Lifecycle operations continue even with partial failures
- Tab switching remains functional despite errors
- Resource cleanup happens even with exceptions
- Clear error messages for users

### 8. Added Input Validation ✅

**Original Issue**: No validation of tab IDs or user inputs

**Solution Implemented**:
- Tab ID format validation with regex pattern
- Title sanitization using `validate_text_input`
- Unique ID generation with collision detection
- Boundary checks for operations
- Maximum tab limit enforcement

## Architecture Improvements

### New Module Structure
```
Chat/
├── tabs/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── tab_context.py      # Widget resolution without monkey patching
│   └── tab_state_manager.py # Thread-safe state management
```

### Key Design Patterns
1. **Dependency Injection**: TabContext passed to functions instead of modifying global state
2. **Singleton Pattern**: TabStateManager ensures single source of truth
3. **Context Manager**: Async context for tab operations
4. **Lifecycle Pattern**: Clear suspend/resume/cleanup states

---

## Testing Considerations

The fixes have been designed with testing in mind:
- TabContext can be easily mocked
- TabStateManager provides clear state inspection
- Error paths are explicit and testable
- No more timing-dependent behavior

---

## Migration Guide

For developers working with the chat tabs:

1. **Replace monkey patching**:
   ```python
   # OLD
   app.query_one = tab_aware_query_one
   
   # NEW
   tab_context = TabContext(app, session_data)
   widget = tab_context.query_one("#chat-input")
   ```

2. **Use lifecycle methods**:
   ```python
   # When switching tabs
   await old_session.suspend()
   await new_session.resume()
   
   # When closing tabs
   await session.cleanup()
   ```

3. **Track unsaved changes**:
   ```python
   # Mark changes
   session.mark_unsaved_changes(True)
   
   # Clear on save
   session.mark_unsaved_changes(False)
   ```

---

## Performance Improvements

- Timers only run for active tabs
- Widget caching reduces repeated queries
- Proper resource cleanup prevents memory growth
- Async operations prevent UI blocking

---

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite should be written
2. **Documentation**: Update user documentation with new features
3. **Monitoring**: Add metrics for tab operations
4. **Feature Flags**: Consider gradual rollout

---

## Conclusion

All critical issues have been addressed with robust, maintainable solutions. The implementation now follows best practices for:
- Framework integration (no monkey patching)
- Concurrency (thread-safe operations)
- Memory management (proper lifecycle)
- Error handling (comprehensive logging and recovery)
- User experience (confirmation dialogs, validation)

The chat tabs feature is now ready for thorough testing and review.
