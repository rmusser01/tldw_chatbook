## Usage Examples

### Basic File Open
```python
from tldw_chatbook.Widgets.enhanced_file_picker import EnhancedFileOpen

# Basic usage - will use last directory from this context
file_dialog = EnhancedFileOpen(
    title="Select a file",
    context="my_feature"  # Unique context for persistent settings
)
```

### With File Filters
```python
from tldw_chatbook.Widgets.enhanced_file_picker import EnhancedFileOpen
from tldw_chatbook.Third_Party.textual_fspicker import Filters

# Create filters
image_filters = Filters(
    ("Images", lambda p: p.suffix.lower() in (".png", ".jpg", ".jpeg")),
    ("PNG files", lambda p: p.suffix.lower() == ".png"),
    ("All files", lambda p: True)
)

# Use with filters
file_dialog = EnhancedFileOpen(
    title="Select Image",
    filters=image_filters,
    context="image_selection"
)
```

### File Save Dialog
```python
from tldw_chatbook.Widgets.enhanced_file_picker import EnhancedFileSave

# Save dialog with default filename
save_dialog = EnhancedFileSave(
    title="Save Document",
    default_filename="document.txt",
    context="document_save"
)
```

## Configuration

The enhanced file picker stores its settings in your TOML config file under the `[filepicker]` section:

```toml
[filepicker]
# Recent files for different contexts
recent_character_import = [
    {path = "/home/user/characters/alice.json", name = "alice.json", type = "file", timestamp = "2024-01-15T10:30:00"},
    {path = "/home/user/characters/bob.png", name = "bob.png", type = "file", timestamp = "2024-01-15T10:25:00"}
]

# Last used directories
last_dir_character_import = "/home/user/characters"
last_dir_notes = "/home/user/documents/notes"

# Bookmarks for different contexts
bookmarks_default = [
    {name = "Home", path = "/home/user", icon = "üè†"},
    {name = "Characters", path = "/home/user/characters", icon = "üìÅ", custom = true}
]
```

## Context Names

The following contexts are pre-configured with the migration:

- `character_import` - Character card imports
- `notes` - Note file operations
- `chat_images` - Chat image attachments
- `note_ingest` - Note ingestion
- `prompt_ingest` - Prompt imports
- `character_ingest` - Character ingestion
- `embeddings` - Embeddings file selection
- `llm_models` - LLM model file selection
- `ollama_models` - Ollama-specific models
- `vllm_models` - vLLM model files
- `transformers_models` - Transformers models
- `onnx_models` - ONNX model files
- `mlx_models` - MLX model files
- `file_open` - Generic file open (default)
- `file_save` - Generic file save (default)

## Advanced Features

### Custom Bookmarks
Users can add their own bookmarks by navigating to a directory and pressing `Ctrl+D`. Custom bookmarks are marked with `custom: true` in the config.

### Search Functionality
The search box filters files in real-time as you type. The search is case-insensitive and matches partial filenames.

### Multiple Contexts
Different features of the app use different contexts, so your character import directory won't interfere with your document directory, etc.

## Migration from Basic File Picker

All existing code has been automatically migrated to use the enhanced file picker. The migration:
1. Replaced imports from `textual_fspicker` with `enhanced_file_picker`
2. Added appropriate context parameters to all file dialogs
3. Maintained backward compatibility with existing code

## Troubleshooting

### Recent Files Not Persisting
- Check that the config file is writable
- Verify the `[filepicker]` section exists in your config
- Check logs for any save errors

### Bookmarks Not Showing
- Press `Ctrl+B` to toggle the bookmarks panel
- Ensure bookmarks are saved in the config
- Try resetting to defaults if corrupted

### Last Directory Not Remembered
- Ensure you're using consistent context names
- Check that the directory still exists
- Verify config file permissions

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements include:
- Drag and drop support
- Multi-file selection
- File preview pane
- Grid view for images
- Favorites filters
- Path auto-completion
- Advanced sorting options

## Testing

Run the test script to verify the enhanced file picker:
```bash
python test_enhanced_filepicker.py
```

This will open a test application where you can try all the features.
