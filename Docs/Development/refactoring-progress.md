# Textual Refactoring Progress Report
## tldw_chatbook Application

**Date:** August 15, 2025  
**Session:** Initial Refactoring Phase  

---

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Planning & Documentation
- Created comprehensive refactoring plan (`textual-refactoring-plan.md`)
- Documented 8-week phased approach
- Identified critical issues and prioritized fixes
- Established success metrics and testing strategy

### 2. Critical Accessibility Fix (REVERTED)
**Issue:** Focus outlines were globally suppressed  
**Initial Fix:** Added WCAG 2.1 compliant focus indicators
**User Feedback:** No borders/outlines wanted by default
**Final Resolution:**
- Modified `/tldw_chatbook/css/core/_reset.tcss` to remove all default outlines/borders
- Rebuilt CSS using `build_css.py` script
- Removed:
  - Focus outlines
  - Hover borders
  - Focus-within borders

### 3. Navigation Architecture Analysis (COMPLETED)
- Documented current hybrid navigation system
- Identified migration path to screen-based navigation
- Created `navigation-architecture-analysis.md`
- Status: 76% → 100% screen implementation complete

### 4. Screen Navigation Completion (COMPLETED)
**Created missing screen classes:**
- ✅ STTSScreen (`UI/Screens/stts_screen.py`)
- ✅ StudyScreen (`UI/Screens/study_screen.py`)
- ✅ ChatbooksScreen (`UI/Screens/chatbooks_screen.py`)
- ✅ SubscriptionScreen (`UI/Screens/subscription_screen.py`)

**Updated navigation handler:**
- ✅ Added all 17 screens to screen_map
- ✅ Improved logging for navigation events
- ✅ Added aliases for consistency

### 5. Screen Navigation Migration (COMPLETED)
**Converted app to screen-based navigation:**
- ✅ Modified `_create_main_ui_widgets()` to skip tab widget creation
- ✅ Updated `on_mount()` to push initial screen
- ✅ Updated `on_splash_screen_closed()` for screen navigation
- ✅ Changed navigation handler to use `switch_screen()` instead of `push_screen()`

**Updated navigation widgets:**
- ✅ TabBar now emits `NavigateToScreen` messages
- ✅ TabLinks now emits `NavigateToScreen` messages
- ✅ Removed direct tab switching logic

**Created test suite:**
- ✅ `test_screen_navigation.py` with comprehensive tests
- ✅ Tests all 17 screens can be navigated to
- ✅ Tests navigation message emission
- ✅ Tests screen lifecycle methods

## 🔄 Next Priority Tasks

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Navigation Architecture Review**
   - Document current tab-based vs screen-based hybrid
   - Make decision on consistent approach
   - Create migration plan if needed

2. **Widget Refactoring Examples**
   - Create template patterns for reactive updates
   - Start with highest-violation files:
     - Chat_Window_Enhanced.py (47 violations)
     - Conv_Char_Window.py (35 violations)

### Short Term (Next 2 Weeks)
3. **State Management Analysis**
   - Map all 65 reactive attributes in app class
   - Design state containers for proper separation
   - Plan message-based communication system

4. **CSS Consolidation Strategy**
   - Inventory all 80 files with inline CSS
   - Design component-based CSS structure
   - Update build system for new organization

---

## 📝 Key Findings

### Positive Discoveries
- CSS build system already in place and working well
- Test infrastructure robust and easy to extend
- Clear separation between generated and source CSS files
- Team aware of issues (previous analysis document exists)

### Challenges Identified
- Mixed navigation paradigm needs resolution
- Heavy use of direct widget manipulation throughout
- State centralized in app class causing coupling
- 80 files with inline CSS will require careful migration

---

## 🎯 Recommendations for Next Session

1. **Priority 1:** Complete navigation architecture decision
   - Review both approaches thoroughly
   - Consider user impact of changes
   - Document decision rationale

2. **Priority 2:** Create working refactoring examples
   - Pick 2-3 representative widgets
   - Show before/after patterns
   - Create reusable templates

3. **Priority 3:** Begin state decomposition planning
   - Map current state relationships
   - Design container hierarchy
   - Plan migration approach

## 💡 Technical Notes

### CSS Build Process
- Source files in `/css/core/`, `/css/components/`, etc.
- Build script: `/css/build_css.py`
- Output: `/css/tldw_cli_modular.tcss`
- Run after any CSS module changes

### Testing Approach
- Unit tests for individual refactored components
- Integration tests for user workflows
- Accessibility tests with new `test_focus_accessibility.py`
- Performance benchmarks before/after changes

### Risk Mitigation
- All changes on separate branch
- Incremental refactoring approach
- Tests added before refactoring
- Documentation updated continuously
