# Backup and recovery

This document describes the ADR-126 complete local backup and restore subsystem: inventory and data groups, admission/quiescing, capture and encrypted archives, replace/isolated restore with journaled publication and encrypted rollback, recovered-media review, and the startup fence. "Recovery" elsewhere (notes-sync crash recovery, server-sync account recovery, fleet worktree recovery) belongs to those subsystems' own docs.

Qualification keeps native identity and operation verdicts fresh on every call. Only parsed installed evidence is cached, by its path and descriptor-verified file generation (device, file identity, size, nanosecond modification and change times). Windows uses native ChangeTime. Changed, missing, malformed or concurrently replaced evidence is refused; a prior refusal is never retained as an authorization cache.

## Authoritative files

| Concern | File | Key symbols |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Service | `Backup_Recovery/recovery_service.py` | `RecoveryService` — one worker composing all engines: backup/restore previews, inspection, extraction, rollback, recovery-copies, profiles |
| CLI + startup unlock | `Backup_Recovery/launcher.py` | `python -m tldw_chatbook.Backup_Recovery` (`inspect / extract / restore / recover / profiles / copies`); `startup_preflight` / `startup_unlock` (master-password prompt, rekey, reset); `minimal_recovery` host |
| Admission | `Backup_Recovery/storage_admission.py`, `admission.py` | `admit_startup()` (called before runtime imports — the fence), `MaintenanceSession`, capture scopes/leases; nested admission forbidden |
| Participants | `Backup_Recovery/participants.py` | `run_finite_local_worker`, installed persistence participants, exact-repository-type → owner-id mapping, participant-coverage requirement |
| Agent worktree directory | `Backup_Recovery/agent_worktree_storage.py` | `prepare_agent_worktrees_base` — ordinary fresh admission for the fixed profile directory while retaining and restoring an enclosing core DB operation |
| Inventory & groups | `Backup_Recovery/inventory.py`, `data_groups.py` | `discover` (no guessed targets on config failure), the 16 `BACKUP_GROUPS` and owner→group map |
| Capture & archives | `capture_service.py`, `capture.py`, `archive_writer.py`, `archive_reader.py` | coherent capture, strict-manifest archive publication, bounded inspection (`CompressionReviewRequired`) |
| Encryption | `crypto.py`, `age_worker.py` | package-owned **age v1**; isolated `python -I` single-scrypt pipe worker; no PATH lookup, no plaintext fallback |
| Restore | `restore_plan.py`, `publication.py`, `journal.py`, `replacement.py`, `later_rollback.py`, `isolated_restore.py`, `inert_extraction.py` | reviewed plans (restore/retire/preserve/issues), journaled publication ("never releases admission"), replace-mode with held original + encrypted rollback, separate-profile restore, inert bytes-only extraction |
| Credentials & copies | `credentials.py`, `rollback_credentials.py`, `recovery_copies.py` | credential-aware staged copies, `--acknowledge-credential-issue`, retained rollback copies |
| Post-restore gating | `activation.py`, `recovered_media*.py` | `execution_allowed` per-owner review gating (imported by app.py), recovered-media review (keep/delete) |
| Profiles | `profile_catalog.py`, `profile_open.py`, `profile_paths.py` | restored-profile locators, open/acknowledge, effective path resolution |
| Schema catalogs | `DB/recovery_core_schema.py`, `recovery_core.py`, `recovery_operations.py` | exact installed `sqlite_schema` SQL per core DB (validation compares actual schemas, not version labels); per-owner adapters; ~20 subsystem `recovery.py` modules feed inventory |
| UI | `UI/Screens/backup_restore_screen.py` (+state), `app_lifecycle.py` | the in-app Backup & Restore screen; `action_backup_restore` entry (Settings Storage + Overview); `request_recovery_restart` guarded quit → CLI restart |
| Legacy helpers | `Backup_Recovery/settings_backup_helpers.py` | the retired settings-backup UI's surviving contracts (named-DB manifest publication, character-card serialization) kept for tests/TTS-profile backup |

Control root is fixed at `<config dir>/recovery/control` (`service_storage.py`); there is no `[backup]` config section — destinations are chosen per operation.

The fixed agent worktree directory is prepared under its own ordinary native
storage admission. Its no-argument Backup_Recovery helper retains a counted outer
AgentRuns operation, suspends only its discovery during that concrete directory
preparation, then restores and revalidates it. The DB operation never grants
filesystem authority; new acquisition still refuses on pause, profile selection
changes or native private-path checks. A refused preparation returns a typed
worktree storage refusal so the retained parent can terminalize an unstarted run.
See ADR-126/228's TASK-35582 AC23-B amendment.


## Backup creation (dataflow)

1. Settings → Storage "Backup & Restore" (or the Overview button) pushes the screen.
2. Preview → `inventory.discover` over the selected configs; group resolution via the owner→group map (unknown owners get no group).
3. `start_backup` → admission: a `MaintenanceSession` with participant coverage checks → coherent capture (SQLite through lock-safe checked capture).
4. Optional age-v1 encryption via the isolated worker.
5. `write_archive` stages payloads under strict manifest names and publishes atomically; publishing inside a selected external source requires an explicit exclusion.

## Restore (dataflow)

1. `start_inspection` → bounded archive inspection (groups, profiles, scope).
2. `preview_restore(mode = isolated | replace)` → a reviewed plan (`restore/retire/preserve/issues/safety_scope`); the CLI prints it and requires typing `restore`.
3. Replace mode additionally requires verified capability, an explicit `--target-config`, typed confirmation, and a **fresh rollback password**.
4. `start_restore` → journal evidence → `finalize_candidate` (fsync, retire originals); the original capture is held and an encrypted rollback archive created. Unselected stored data is **preserved**, not deleted (ADR-126 rev 4).
5. Post-restore: `activation.execution_allowed` gates features per owner until restored generations are reviewed; recovered media lands under `<user_data>/recovered_media` with a keep/delete review flow.

Interrupted operations recover through `recover <operation-id> --finish|--rollback|--abort` with typed confirmation; rollback needs the rollback password; retained copies are listable/inspectable.

## Startup fence and unlock

`admit_startup()` runs before runtime/config imports (literally the first lines of `app.py` and `Web_Server/serve.py`, and several package `__init__`s — `Web_Server`, `RAG_Search`, `TTS`); enrollment failure is a hard `SystemExit("Recovery required: …")`. When config encryption is enabled with a verifier, `startup_unlock` prompts pre-TUI: a wrong-but-readable password offers rekey; an empty one resets encrypted config values (keys removed; chats/notes untouched). Served children refuse the unlock with a plain-language error rather than hanging. Non-unlock recovery reasons get the minimal recovery host. A recovery restart (app → CLI handoff) checks no running operation and no unsaved editors, quits guarded, and spawns a fresh process into the minimal recovery host.

Same-process initialization followers wait on the existing `_changed` condition (TASK-35595). Initializer retirement/error, acquisition close and local-pause cancellation notify under the same lock. The original acquisition/path/provenance checks run at entry and after waking; native admission still follows before any dependent effect. Removing the 10 ms wake timer avoids repeating native path checks under the shared lock while the leader is unchanged. This does not change native cross-process lock polling, deadlines, source validation or lease retirement.

Creation-intent ancestry validation uses the internal visitor of `native_files.pinned_directory` to inspect every existing parent in a single nofollow traversal (ADR-126, TASK-35595). Each descriptor reaches the visitor only after its original owner/mode check and is borrowed only for that call. Missing descendants do not hide existing ancestor intents; visitor errors and native close errors propagate. No settled verdict or directory handle is cached between acquisitions.

## Failure behaviors and boundaries

| Case | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Config parse failure at inventory | No guessed targets — discovery yields nothing |
| FIFO/non-regular config | Refused (non-blocking open, regular-file check) |
| Journal/publication crash | Admission never released by record labels; recovery resumes via `recover` |
| Restore without review | `execution_allowed` blocks feature execution per owner |
| Extract request | Inert bytes to a chosen directory — never profile/schema restoration |
| Fresh-install securing failure | `~/.tldw_cli-data` fallback (ADR-127) with a plain-language diagnostic |
| `run_finite_local_worker` cancel | Only that worker's file-backed caches retire; in-transaction/foreign handles survive |

## Governing decisions

ADR-126 (`126-complete-local-backup-and-recovery.md`, rev 4 with amendments), ADR-127 (`127-fresh-install-private-data-root-recovery.md`), ADR-125 (`125-lock-safe-private-sqlite-validation.md`). Specs/plans: the `2026-09-07-complete-local-backup-restore*` series, `2026-09-15-selectable-backup-groups*`, `2026-09-12-python-backup-encryption*` (under `Docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/`). Tests: `Tests/Backup_Recovery/` (331 files).

## Verified gotchas

1. The schema catalogs are **exact-SQL**: requalification compares actual installed schema text, not version labels — relabeling is forbidden by the module header.
2. `run_finite_local_worker` closes only caches that worker acquired; exact repository classes confer authority ("subclasses confer no authority").
3. `settings_backup_helpers.py` documents a **retired** UI kept alive by tests and the TTS-profile backup contract — the user-facing surface is the Backup & Restore screen.
4. Restoring an old DB does not auto-activate its contents — imported history stays inert until fresh live claims are allocated.
5. The Settings Storage card warns that path changes apply on next launch (active DB handles keep current paths) — backup/restore works on the admitted set, not mid-flight handles.

## Archive chronology schema integration (ADR166)

Core recovery retains the frozen predecessor catalogs and appends exact schema85 successors after the preserved schema81/82/83/84 lineages and installed shared Subscriptions layouts. Canvas payload validation remains limited to those exact catalogs. Restricted backup migration admits only the fixed chat84→85 chronology step and its declared column/index/trigger effects. Workspace backup validation retains frozen schema8/9 catalogs and admits the fixed9→10 chronology step before exact successor qualification. The existing schema8 migration refusal remains unchanged. Existing source, quiescence, payload and native-handle guards remain binding.
