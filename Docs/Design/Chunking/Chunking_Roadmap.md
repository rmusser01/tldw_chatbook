# Chunking System Roadmap

## Overview

This document outlines planned enhancements and future directions for the chunking system. Items are organized by priority and estimated complexity.

## Short-term Enhancements (1-3 months)

### 1. Performance Optimizations

#### Streaming Architecture
**Priority**: High  
**Complexity**: Medium

- Implement true streaming for unlimited document sizes
- Process chunks as they're created rather than storing all in memory
- Enable progress callbacks for long-running operations

```python
# Proposed API
def chunk_text_streaming(self, text_stream, callback=None):
    for chunk in self._process_stream(text_stream):
        if callback:
            callback(chunk, progress)
        yield chunk
```

        return {
            'coherence_score': self._measure_coherence(chunks),
            'completeness_score': self._measure_completeness(chunks),
            'overlap_quality': self._analyze_overlap(chunks),
