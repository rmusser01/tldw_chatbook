# File Extraction Enhancement Summary

## Overview
Enhanced the existing file extraction functionality in the chat window to support more file types and improved user experience.

## Key Enhancements Implemented

### 1. Added New File Type Support
Added support for the following data-oriented file types to `LANGUAGE_EXTENSIONS` in `file_extraction.py`:

- **TSV** (.tsv) - Tab-separated values
- **VCF/vCard** (.vcf, .vcard) - Contact files
- **ICS/iCal** (.ics, .ical) - Calendar files
- **GPX** (.gpx) - GPS/location data
- **KML** (.kml) - Geographic data (Google Earth)
- **DOT** (.dot) - GraphViz graph files
- **PlantUML** (.puml, .plantuml) - Diagram definitions
- **Mermaid** (.mmd, .mermaid) - Diagram definitions

### 2. Markdown Table Detection
Added automatic detection and conversion of markdown tables to CSV files:
- Detects tables with header separator rows (e.g., `|---|---|`)
- Converts table data to proper CSV format
- Attempts to find table titles/captions for better filenames
- Handles tables with varying column alignments

### 3. Enhanced File Validation
Added comprehensive validation for different file types:
- **CSV/TSV**: Validates consistent column counts and proper formatting
- **JSON**: Validates JSON syntax
- **YAML**: Validates YAML syntax
- **XML**: Validates XML structure
- **VCF**: Checks for proper vCard format
- **ICS**: Checks for proper iCalendar format
- **DOT**: Validates GraphViz syntax
- **PlantUML**: Checks for proper start/end tags
- **Mermaid**: Validates diagram type declarations
- **SQL**: Warns about potentially dangerous operations

### 4. Improved UI Experience
Enhanced the FileExtractionDialog with:
- **File type icons**: Visual indicators for different file types (üêç for Python, üìä for CSV, etc.)
- **Better file size display**: Shows sizes in B, KB, or MB as appropriate
- **File count in title**: Shows total number of extracted files
- **"Save All" functionality**: Already existed but now more prominent
- **Improved filename editing**: Updates icon when filename changes

### 5. Security Enhancements
- Filename sanitization to remove invalid characters
- Path validation to prevent directory traversal
- File size limits to prevent memory issues
- Content validation before offering downloads

## How It Works

1. **For Code Blocks**: When an LLM response contains code blocks (` ``` `), they are automatically detected and the extract button appears
2. **For Markdown Tables**: Tables in markdown format are automatically detected and converted to CSV files
3. **File Detection**: The system attempts to detect filenames from context (e.g., "Save as config.yaml:")
4. **Validation**: Files are validated based on their type before being offered for download
5. **Download**: Users can download individual files or all files at once to their Downloads folder

## Testing
Created comprehensive test suite that validates:
- Markdown table extraction
- Code block extraction for all new file types
- Filename detection from context
- File validation for each type
- Mixed content with both tables and code blocks

All tests pass successfully, confirming the functionality works as expected.

## User Benefits
1. **Easier Data Export**: Users can now easily extract tables from LLM responses as CSV files
2. **More File Types**: Support for calendar files, contact cards, diagrams, and geographic data
3. **Better Organization**: Files are automatically named based on context when possible
4. **Visual Clarity**: File type icons make it easy to identify different file types
5. **Validation**: Files are validated before download to ensure they're properly formatted

## Code Quality
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing code
- Added comprehensive error handling
- Included detailed documentation
- Followed existing code patterns and conventions
- Added proper type hints and validation
