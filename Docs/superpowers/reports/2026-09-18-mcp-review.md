# MCP component review

This ledger separates qualified repairs from remaining destination behavior.
Token migration alone does not qualify a complete workflow.

## Post-review MCP catalog and guidance — TASK-32840

[49 targeted cases, seven preflight guards and eight inspected native captures](../qa/2026-09-19-mcp-recovery-catalog/README.md)
qualify passive repopulation of reviewed local definitions, current-view
publication through navigation/service changes, successful approval with a
catalog retry warning, and accurate retained-history guidance. No discovery,
connection or grants occur. The private native app exits normally with unchanged
user defaults; one unrelated Evals enrollment diagnostic is recorded.

This follow-up stacks on PR #2727's ownership guards and closes its deferred
catalog/guidance items. Retarget its draft to dev after the parent merges.
Next review: bulk permission actions and approval workflows, then remaining
connected-runtime journeys. Current-head CI and final visual approval still
gate merging. The resume heartbeat remains paused.

## Post-merge restored MCP review completion — TASK-32839

PR #2707 merged into dev at `149acda36be8939fe8cd5e589bf77d13462257e7`.
Its unmerged closeout checkpoint below is historical; component review resumed
on bounded follow-up branches and the resume heartbeat remains paused.

[45 targeted cases, seven preflight guards and 16 inspected native captures](../qa/2026-09-18-mcp-restored-roots/README.md)
qualify accepted-review receipt ownership through native completion/rendering,
mode and screen round trips, service replacement, fresh Ask/local defaults and
clearing old passive catalog displays. Real owner approval, cancellation and
changed-root rejection remain intact. The private app exited cleanly with user
defaults unchanged. One unrelated restored Evals enrollment diagnostic is recorded.

This fresh-dev branch is independent of Audit PRs #2724/#2726 and earlier
inspector/lifecycle follow-ups. It does not reload discovery or qualify connected
runtime use. Next review: post-review catalog repopulation/status guidance,
then bulk permission actions and approval workflows. Current-head CI and final
visual approval still gate merging this draft.

## PR #2707 closeout boundary

The owner approved moving remaining MCP reviews to follow-up PRs. TASK-32823
is preserved on `codex/mcp-inspector-refresh-followup` at `135f226888`, outside
PR #2707. Its inspector refresh prototype has an unresolved delayed-preview
ownership race; it is not qualified or complete. Resume MCP lifecycle/inspector
work from merged `dev` after the current PR receives final visual approval and
its merge is confirmed.

## Remaining review

- **Remote verification:** Fast Lane, CSS, latency, backlog and all platform GGUF
  checks pass on saved head d7b4c10a7d. The derived-artifact aggregate is still
  running at this checkpoint; checks on the next pushed head are separate.
  TASK-32814 repaired the earlier rail ellipsis assertion failure.
- **Existing test debt:** four Audit CSS literal assertions fail against unchanged
  token-based CSS; two Speech harness cases failed during profile setup before UI
  creation. Both boundaries are recorded in TASK-32796 evidence. TASK-32812 also
  recorded 26 baseline CSS-consolidation ratchet offenders and a destination-tour
  profile-setup failure; TASK-32813 now closes those two boundaries with
  [computed-style, guard and native evidence](../qa/2026-09-18-css-consolidation/README.md).
- **Inspector refresh and execution:** selected tool definition/currentness,
  argument drafts across background refresh, diagnostic empty-state action routing,
  disconnected/stale tools, schema/raw arguments, execution and inspector recovery.
- **Servers:** source transitions, add/edit/remove and connection lifecycles,
  built-in enable/expose controls, errors and recovery. TASK-32822 repairs the
  compact non-master gate label clipping recorded in TASK-32793. The All servers
  rail clipping recorded in TASK-32796 is repaired by TASK-32812 above.
- **Audit and remaining permissions:** filtering, exact tool/event drilldown,
  restored roots, bulk actions, review/approval and connected-runtime journeys.

The [component completion ledger](2026-09-17-design-system-completion-audit.md)
retains other destinations. Draft PR2707 remains open and subject to its own
visual review and merge approval.
