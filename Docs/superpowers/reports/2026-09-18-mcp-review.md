# MCP component review

This ledger separates qualified repairs from remaining destination behavior.
Token migration alone does not qualify a complete workflow.

## Current continuation — TASK-32836

PR #2707 merged at `149acda36be8939fe8cd5e589bf77d13462257e7` on 2026-09-18.
Its closeout notes below are historical; post-merge work is underway and the
backup heartbeat remains paused. Follow-ups keep their own visual approval gate.

TASK-32836 extends the inspector's existing visibility owner to the complete
server readiness block. The badge, explanation and actions hide together while
tool, permission, Audit or finding detail is present; clearing the last detail
reveals current server guidance. [62 targeted checks and 16 native captures](../qa/2026-09-18-mcp-inspector-guidance/README.md)
verify that boundary on fresh `dev` (`cef6bd2a3e3f0b8de0e166146acb4900ca7ea2b6`).
The native gallery still shows the baseline compact Audit filter and inspector
layout; those independent repairs remain in their own follow-ups.

Audit selection and filter layout are saved separately in
[PR #2720](https://github.com/rmusser01/tldw_chatbook/pull/2720) and
[PR #2721](https://github.com/rmusser01/tldw_chatbook/pull/2721), with green
checks at `4c5cfaebe9696780908219b6d5cd023a44fe0909` and
`8ba5f72f0b6c045756e6b1761e83bbf819410744`. They remain drafts awaiting visual
approval. Next bounded review: Audit's Open tool / Adjust permission drilldowns,
including missing or stale tool context. Remaining connected-runtime and
permission workflows, and the wider destination review, remain open.

## PR #2707 closeout boundary

The owner approved moving remaining MCP reviews to follow-up PRs. TASK-32823
is preserved on `codex/mcp-inspector-refresh-followup` at `135f226888`, outside
PR #2707. Its inspector refresh prototype has an unresolved delayed-preview
ownership race; it is not qualified or complete. Resume MCP lifecycle/inspector
work from merged `dev` after the current PR receives final visual approval and
its merge is confirmed.

## Remaining review

- **Remote verification:** Fast Lane, CSS, latency, backlog and all platform GGUF
  checks pass on saved head d7b4c10a7d. The derived-artifact aggregate is still
  running at this checkpoint; checks on the next pushed head are separate.
  TASK-32814 repaired the earlier rail ellipsis assertion failure.
- **Existing test debt:** four Audit CSS literal assertions fail against unchanged
  token-based CSS; two Speech harness cases failed during profile setup before UI
  creation. Both boundaries are recorded in TASK-32796 evidence. TASK-32812 also
  recorded 26 baseline CSS-consolidation ratchet offenders and a destination-tour
  profile-setup failure; TASK-32813 now closes those two boundaries with
  [computed-style, guard and native evidence](../qa/2026-09-18-css-consolidation/README.md).
- **Inspector refresh and execution:** selected tool definition/currentness,
  argument drafts across background refresh, diagnostic empty-state action routing,
  disconnected/stale tools, schema/raw arguments, execution and inspector recovery.
- **Servers:** source transitions, add/edit/remove and connection lifecycles,
  built-in enable/expose controls, errors and recovery. TASK-32822 repairs the
  compact non-master gate label clipping recorded in TASK-32793. The All servers
  rail clipping recorded in TASK-32796 is repaired by TASK-32812 above.
- **Audit and remaining permissions:** filtering, exact tool/event drilldown,
  restored roots, bulk actions, review/approval and connected-runtime journeys.

The [component completion ledger](2026-09-17-design-system-completion-audit.md)
retains other destinations. Draft PR2707 remains open and subject to its own
visual review and merge approval.
