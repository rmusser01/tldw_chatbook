# Cross-platform backup correction plan

TASK-32496. Spec: ../specs/2026-09-12-cross-platform-backup-correction.md.
ADR required: existing ADR amendment.
ADR path: backlog/decisions/126-complete-local-backup-and-recovery.md.
Reason: correct platform operation contracts without changing recovery behavior.

Use subagent-driven development for the Windows native boundary and independent
review. Root owns Linux implementation, actual product testing, task tracking and
PR publication. Keep file ownership disjoint until reviewed integration.

## Stage 1 — Reproduce and map
Status: Complete.
Record real Linux product failure and native Windows runner failure. Map calls to
private paths, locking, identity, flush and exclusive publication.

## Stage 2 — Platform operations
Status: In Progress. Linux and macOS operations verified; Windows adapter reviewed, runner ownership refusal under diagnosis.
Windows implementer owns new platform adapter modules and Windows primitive tests.
Root owns Linux native operations, integration imports and release contracts.
Preserve containment, permissions, exclusive rename and failure propagation.

## Stage 3 — Actual product verification
Status: In Progress. Linux and macOS full product flows pass at7d1019190; Windows34707982570 stopped in fixture startup. Next run separates native operations and records anonymous ancestor permission evidence.
Use installed package, private profile and synthetic data on supplied Linux host,
GitHub Actions Windows runner and local macOS. Create and verify backups, restore
and open them, then exercise replacement and retained-copy rollback. Fix failures.

## Stage 4 — Review and PR evidence
Status: In Progress. Native adapter, integration and SQLite snapshot reviews addressed; PR updated with actual incomplete Windows status.
Independent review of changed boundaries and evidence; targeted static/Bandit
checks; update existing PR2642 with exact results and platform support.
