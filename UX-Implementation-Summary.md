   - Changed from "☰" to "◀ Hide Sidebar"/"▶ Show Sidebar"
   - Dynamic text update based on collapsed state
   - Better hover and focus states

2. **Expanded Collapsibles by Default** ✅
   - Model Information
   - Collection Information
   - Test Embeddings
   - Performance Metrics
   - All now show content immediately

3. **Loading Overlays** ✅
   - Added loading overlay that covers right pane during operations
   - Shows LoadingIndicator with custom message
   - Implemented for: Download, Load, Unload, Generate operations

4. **Confirmation Dialogs** ✅
   - Created modal dialogs for delete operations

   - Cancel/Confirm button pattern
   - Proper modal background overlay

### CSS Enhancements ✅
- Enhanced toggle button styling
- Loading overlay styles with proper layering
- Modal dialog styling
- Sticky footer implementation
- Tabbed content support

## Phase 1 Complete! ✅

All Phase 1 tasks have been successfully implemented:

### Form Validation and Error States ✅
- Real-time validation for all inputs
- Error message displays below each field
- Validation includes:
  - Model selection (required)
  - File/database selection based on source type
  - Collection name (required, no spaces, alphanumeric with _ and -)
  - Chunk size (50-10000)
  - Chunk overlap (non-negative, less than chunk size)
- Clear error messages with ❌ icons
- General error summary at bottom
- Errors clear automatically when fields are corrected
- Event handlers for all buttons (Create, Preview, Clear)
- Form reset functionality

### Enhanced Model Discovery ✅
- Scans user's local model directory (~/.local/share/tldw_cli/models/embeddings)
- Integrates with embedding configuration
- Shows OpenAI models and configured models
- Displays local models with "local/" prefix
- Falls back to default models if none found

### Phase 2 Tasks (Not Started)
1. **Improved List Components**
   - Custom ListItem widgets with preview info
   - Batch selection capabilities
   - Empty states with action prompts

2. **Better Visual Design**
   - Section backgrounds for grouping
   - Focus states
   - Hover effects
   - Consistent spacing system

3. **Form Enhancements**
   - Inline help icons with tooltips
   - Progressive disclosure for advanced options
   - Smart defaults based on model selection
   - Preview system for chunking results

### Phase 3 Tasks (Future)
1. **Workflow Optimization**
   - Keyboard shortcuts
   - Recent/favorite models
   - Batch operations
   - Configuration templates

2. **Better Feedback Systems**
   - Toast notifications
   - Detailed progress
   - Activity log
   - Performance metrics

## Technical Notes

### Key Changes Made
- Used TabbedContent from Textual for form organization
- Implemented reactive watchers for UI state management
- Created ModalScreen subclasses for dialogs
- Used dock property for sticky footer and overlays
- Applied proper Textual CSS patterns (no position absolute/relative)

### Patterns Established
- Loading state management with reactive attributes
- Confirmation dialog pattern for destructive actions
- Conditional visibility with CSS classes
- Watcher pattern for dynamic UI updates

## Next Steps
The most impactful next step would be implementing form validation, as it directly affects user experience and prevents errors. After that, improving the list components with preview information would significantly enhance usability.
