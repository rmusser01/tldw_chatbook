## feat: Implement complete tool calling functionality

### Summary
Implemented full tool calling support for LLM interactions, enabling automatic execution of tools like calculator and datetime functions when requested by AI models.

### Changes

**Core Implementation**:
- Added tool execution in streaming responses (chat_streaming_events.py)
- Added tool execution in non-streaming responses (worker_events.py) 
- Created conversation continuation function to handle tool results
- Updated StreamDone message to carry response data for tool detection

**Features**:
- ✅ Automatic tool detection from LLM responses (OpenAI, Anthropic formats)
- ✅ Safe tool execution with timeouts and error handling
- ✅ Visual display of tool calls and results using ToolExecutionWidget
- ✅ Database persistence of tool messages with role='tool'
- ✅ Automatic conversation continuation with tool results
- ✅ Support for concurrent tool execution
- ✅ Built-in tools: calculator and get_current_datetime

**Documentation**:
- Updated TOOL-CALLING.md to reflect completed implementation
- Created TOOL-CALLING-IMPLEMENTATION.md with detailed summary
- Fixed test errors by adding AsyncMock import and handling PyTorch meta tensors

### Testing
The implementation includes comprehensive error handling and has been designed to gracefully handle:
- Tool execution failures
- Missing UI elements
- Database errors
- Timeout scenarios

### Next Steps
Future enhancements can include:
- Additional built-in tools (web search, file operations)
- Tool configuration UI in settings
- User permission system for tools
- Custom tool builder interface

This completes the tool calling feature, making tldw_chatbook capable of executing functions requested by LLMs to provide more accurate and useful responses.
