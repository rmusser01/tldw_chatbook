# Tab Switching Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. QueryError: No nodes match '#conv-char-character-select'
**Problem**: When the CCP tab was the initial tab or accessed via lazy loading, the populate functions were called before the window's widgets were fully mounted.

**Solution**: 
- Changed from `call_after_refresh` to `set_timer(0.1, ...)` to add a small delay
- Added more robust early exit checks in populate functions to verify both window and widget existence

### 2. KeyError: '-dark-mode'
**Problem**: CSS parsing error when placeholder containers had conflicting classes.

**Solution**:
- Removed "window" class from placeholder containers to avoid CSS conflicts
- Placeholders now only have the "placeholder-window" class

### 3. Hide Inactive Windows Issue
**Problem**: The `hide_inactive_windows` method was trying to process placeholders as regular windows.

**Solution**:
- Updated query to include both ".window" and ".placeholder-window"
- Added explicit handling to always hide placeholders

## Changes Made

### `/tldw_chatbook/app.py`
1. Modified `compose_content_area` to not apply "window" class to placeholders
2. Updated `watch_current_tab` to use `set_timer` instead of `call_after_refresh`
3. Fixed `hide_inactive_windows` to handle placeholders correctly

### `/tldw_chatbook/Event_Handlers/conv_char_events.py`
1. Enhanced early exit checks in `populate_ccp_character_select` to verify widget existence
2. Enhanced early exit checks in `populate_ccp_prompts_list_view` to verify widget existence

## Technical Details

The lazy loading optimization creates placeholder containers for non-initial tabs to improve startup performance. The issue occurred because:

1. Placeholders were being treated as regular windows
2. Population functions were called before widget trees were fully constructed
3. CSS class conflicts between placeholders and actual windows

The fixes ensure proper timing and handling of the lazy loading mechanism while maintaining the performance benefits.
