# Database Corruption Test Report

## Summary

## Test Results

### ✅ Passing Tests
1. **ChaChaNotes DB Core Tests** (31/31 passed)
   - All basic database operations work correctly
   - Character cards, conversations, messages, notes, keywords all functional
   - Transactions, soft deletes, and sync logging working properly

2. **Property-Based Tests** (26/26 passed)
   - Data integrity tests passed
   - Concurrency tests passed
   - Foreign key constraint validation passed
   - Backup/restore correctness verified
   - No corruption detected in core functionality

3. **World Info Processor Tests** (15/15 passed)
   - World info processing logic works correctly
   - The corruption appears to be specific to database operations

4. **Database Compatibility Tests** (12/12 passed)
   - Image storage and retrieval working
   - Performance tests passed
   - Concurrent operations handled correctly

### ❌ Failing Tests
1. **World Book Manager Tests** (15/17 passed, 2 failed)
   - `test_update_world_book` - **FAILED**
   - `test_update_world_book_entry` - **FAILED**
   - Both failures show: `sqlite3.DatabaseError: database disk image is malformed`

## Corruption Analysis

### Error Pattern
The corruption specifically occurs during UPDATE operations on the world_books table:
```
sqlite3.DatabaseError: database disk image is malformed
```

### Location
- File: `tldw_chatbook/Character_Chat/world_book_manager.py`
- Line: 264 (in `update_world_book` method)
- Operation: `cursor.execute(query, params)` during UPDATE

### Specific Characteristics
1. **Timing**: Occurs during UPDATE operations, not INSERT or SELECT
2. **Table**: Specifically affects the `world_books` table (part of schema v9)
3. **Pattern**: The database is successfully created and initial INSERT works, but UPDATE fails
4. **Consistency**: Reproducible - fails consistently in the same tests

### Root Cause Indicators
1. The issue appears after successful table creation and initial data insertion
2. Only UPDATE operations trigger the corruption
3. The world_books table was added in schema migration v8→v9
4. Other tables don't exhibit this issue

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Investigation Needed**:
   - Check if there are any triggers on the world_books table that might be causing issues
   - Verify the UPDATE query construction in the world_book_manager
   - Check for any concurrent access issues specific to world_books

2. **Potential Causes**:
   - Malformed UPDATE query syntax
   - Trigger conflicts during UPDATE operations
   - WAL mode issues with the specific table structure
   - Schema migration v9 may have introduced a subtle bug

3. **Next Steps**:
   - Examine the FTS5 triggers for world_books
   - Test UPDATE operations in isolation
   - Check if disabling triggers temporarily fixes the issue
   - Review the schema migration v8→v9 for any anomalies

## Test Command Reference

To reproduce the issue:
```bash
# Run the specific failing test
pytest Tests/Character_Chat/test_world_book_manager.py::TestWorldBookManager::test_update_world_book -vvs

# Run all world book tests
pytest Tests/Character_Chat/test_world_book_manager.py -v
```

## Conclusion

The corruption issue is confirmed and isolated to UPDATE operations on the world_books table. This is a critical issue that needs immediate attention as it prevents proper functioning of the world book/lore book feature.
