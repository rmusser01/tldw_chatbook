- [x] Save message data (role, content, timestamp, metadata)
- [x] Restore messages when returning to chat
- [x] Preserve scroll positions
- [x] Handle image data in messages

### Phase 6: UI State Management [PENDING]
- [ ] Save sidebar collapse states
- [ ] Restore UI layout preferences
- [ ] Handle settings sidebar visibility
- [ ] Preserve compact mode settings

### Phase 7: Navigation Guards [PENDING]
- [ ] Check for unsaved changes
- [ ] Implement confirmation dialogs
- [ ] Add auto-save draft functionality
- [ ] Handle graceful state recovery

### Phase 8: Testing & Validation [PENDING]
- [ ] Unit tests for state serialization
- [ ] Integration tests for navigation flows
- [ ] Performance tests with multiple tabs
- [ ] Edge case handling

## Technical Considerations

### Potential Issues Identified

1. **Memory Management**
   - **Issue**: Caching all messages could consume significant memory
   - **Solution**: Implement message limit per tab (e.g., last 100 messages)
   - **Status**: Need to add message pruning logic

2. **State Synchronization**
   - **Issue**: State could become out of sync with actual widgets
   - **Solution**: Use reactive properties and proper event handling
   - **Status**: Need to ensure proper reactive binding

3. **Performance**
   - **Issue**: Restoring many tabs could cause UI lag
   - **Solution**: Lazy loading - only restore active tab immediately
   - **Status**: Need to implement deferred restoration

4. **Attachment Handling**
   - **Issue**: File references might become invalid
   - **Solution**: Validate file existence on restore
   - **Status**: Need file validation logic

5. **Concurrent Modifications**
   - **Issue**: User might modify state during save/restore
   - **Solution**: Use state snapshots and atomic operations
   - **Status**: Added `create_snapshot()` method

## Architecture Decisions

### State Storage Strategy
- **In-Memory**: Primary storage during session
- **Temporary File**: Optional persistence between app restarts
- **Database**: Not used for draft state (too heavy)

### Serialization Format
- **Format**: Python dictionaries (JSON-compatible)
- **Reason**: Easy to serialize, human-readable, debuggable
- **Alternative Considered**: Pickle (rejected - security concerns)

### Restoration Strategy
- **Immediate**: Active tab and UI state
- **Deferred**: Inactive tabs and message history
- **On-Demand**: Large attachments and images

## Next Steps

1. Implement ChatScreen save/restore methods
2. Add state extraction to ChatTabContainer
3. Test with single tab first
4. Extend to multi-tab scenarios
5. Add performance optimizations

## Code Quality Checklist

- [x] Type hints on all public methods
- [x] Docstrings following Google style
- [x] Proper error handling
- [x] Logging for debugging
- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] Performance benchmarks

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Data Loss Prevention**
   - Auto-save on navigation
   - Confirmation dialogs for unsaved changes
   - Recovery from corrupted state

2. **Performance Degradation**
   - Message count limits
   - Lazy loading strategies
   - Background state operations

3. **User Experience**
   - Seamless restoration
   - Progress indicators for large restores
   - Graceful degradation on errors

## Success Metrics

- Navigation and return < 100ms for typical usage
- Zero data loss on navigation
- Memory usage < 50MB for 10 tabs
- User satisfaction with state preservation

## Dependencies

- Textual 0.86.0+ (for screen lifecycle methods)
- Python 3.11+ (for better typing support)
- No external dependencies required

   - Added `_restore_messages()` method to restore conversation on return
   - Creates new message widgets and mounts them to chat log
   - Maintains complete conversation continuity

### How It Works

When navigating away from the chat screen:
1. `NavigateToScreen` event triggers state save
2. ChatScreen.save_state() captures all tab states
3. State stored in app._screen_states dictionary
4. Screen switches to new destination

When returning to the chat screen:
1. New ChatScreen instance created
2. State retrieved from app._screen_states
3. ChatScreen.restore_state() called with saved state
4. Tabs, messages, and UI state restored
5. User continues exactly where they left off

### Diagnostic Tool Usage

The diagnostic tool can be used to understand the chat widget structure:

```python
from tldw_chatbook.Utils.chat_diagnostics import diagnose_chat_screen

# Run diagnostics on a chat screen
report = diagnose_chat_screen(chat_screen)

# Report includes:
# - Widget type counts
# - TextArea locations and content
# - Container structure analysis
# - Interface type detection (tabbed/single/unknown)
# - Recommendations for state capture
```

The diagnostic automatically runs when the chat screen mounts and logs its findings.

### Key Benefits
- **Zero Data Loss** - All typed text preserved
- **Multi-Tab Support** - All tabs maintained
- **Seamless Experience** - Transparent to user
- **Performance** - Efficient state management
- **Extensible** - Easy to add more state fields
