# Speaker Diarization Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented speaker diarization for tldw_chatbook using a vector embeddings approach. The implementation supports both faster-whisper and nemo (parakeet/canary) backends.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Lazy Import System
- All heavy dependencies (torch, speechbrain, sklearn, numpy, torchaudio) are lazily loaded
- Service can check availability without importing dependencies
- Application won't crash if diarization dependencies are missing
- Dependencies are only loaded when diarization is actually used

### 2. Core Diarization Pipeline
1. **Voice Activity Detection (VAD)** - Uses Silero VAD to detect speech segments
2. **Segment Creation** - Creates overlapping fixed-length segments for analysis
3. **Speaker Embeddings** - Extracts ECAPA-TDNN embeddings using SpeechBrain
4. **Clustering** - Uses spectral clustering to identify speakers
5. **Segment Merging** - Merges consecutive segments from same speaker
6. **Transcription Alignment** - Aligns diarization with transcription segments

### 3. Configuration
Added comprehensive configuration options in config.toml:
```toml
[diarization]
enabled = false
vad_threshold = 0.5
embedding_model = "speechbrain/spkrec-ecapa-voxceleb"
clustering_method = "spectral"
min_speakers = 1
max_speakers = 10
```

### 4. Integration with TranscriptionService
- Added `diarize` parameter to transcribe() method
- Added `num_speakers` parameter for known speaker counts
- Formats output with speaker labels (SPEAKER_0, SPEAKER_1, etc.)
- Progress callbacks include diarization stages

### 5. Testing
- 19 tests all passing
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests with real audio generation
- No mocking in integration tests - tests actual multi-speaker scenarios

## Installation
```bash
# Install diarization dependencies
pip install -e ".[diarization]"

# Or install individually
pip install torch torchaudio speechbrain scikit-learn numpy
```

## Usage
```python
# Basic usage
result = transcription_service.transcribe(
    audio_path="meeting.wav",
    provider="faster-whisper",
    diarize=True
)

# With known speakers
result = transcription_service.transcribe(
    audio_path="interview.wav", 
    provider="faster-whisper",
    diarize=True,
    num_speakers=2
)

# Format with speakers
formatted = transcription_service.format_segments_with_timestamps(
    result['segments'],
    include_timestamps=True,
    include_speakers=True
)
```

## Technical Decisions

### Lazy Imports Implementation
- Used global module variables with lazy initialization functions
- Type annotations use strings to avoid importing at module level
- Availability checks don't trigger imports
- Each heavy dependency has its own lazy import function

### Error Handling
- Service gracefully degrades when dependencies missing
- Clear error messages indicate which dependencies are needed
- Availability can be checked before attempting diarization

### Performance Considerations
- Progress callbacks for long audio files
- Segment-based processing for memory efficiency
- Configurable clustering parameters
- GPU support when available (auto-detected)
