# tldw_chatbook/Widgets/Evals_Sidebar.py
#
# This file is kept for backward compatibility but its functionality has been integrated
# directly into the EvalsWindow class (tldw_chatbook/UI/Evals_Window.py).
#
# The EvalsSidebar class has been replaced with a navigation pane in EvalsWindow that
# provides similar functionality with a more consistent UI matching the Code tab.
