# Evals UI Fix Summary

## Problem
The Evals UI window was only showing the header box when navigating to the Evaluations tab. All other UI elements (configuration sections, buttons, progress bars, results table) were not visible.

## Root Cause
CSS layout conflict between:
1. Global `.window` class in `tldw_cli_modular.tcss` which sets `layout: horizontal`
2. EvalsWindow's need for `layout: vertical` to properly display its stacked UI elements

When EvalsWindow was instantiated with the "window" class, the horizontal layout from the global CSS would override the vertical layout specified in EvalsWindow's DEFAULT_CSS, causing all child containers to be laid out horizontally instead of vertically.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. CSS Override (Primary Fix)
Added specific CSS rule in `tldw_cli_modular.tcss`:
```css
/* Override horizontal layout from .window class for evals window */
#evals-window.window {
    layout: vertical !important;
}
```

### 2. Programmatic Backup (Secondary Fix)
Modified `EvalsWindow.__init__()` in `evals_window_v2.py` to explicitly set vertical layout:
```python
self.styles.layout = "vertical"  # Force vertical layout to override .window class
```

## Files Modified
1. `/Users/appledev/Working/tldw_chatbook/tldw_chatbook/css/tldw_cli_modular.tcss` - Added CSS override
2. `/Users/appledev/Working/tldw_chatbook/tldw_chatbook/UI/evals_window_v2.py` - Added programmatic layout enforcement

## Testing Required
1. Launch the application
2. Navigate to the Evaluations tab
3. Verify all UI elements are visible:
   - Task Configuration section with dropdowns and buttons
   - Model Configuration section with inputs
   - Cost Estimation section
   - Run Evaluation button
   - Progress section
   - Results table
4. Test functionality of interactive elements

## Result
The Evals UI should now display all components correctly with proper vertical layout, restoring full functionality and interactivity.
