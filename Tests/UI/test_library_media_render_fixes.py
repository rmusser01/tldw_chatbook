"""Render fixes from the 2026-09-03 re-critique (tasks 31221, 31222).

Two verified rendering bugs, both only reproducible on the REAL screen path
(the library's split stylesheet loads lazily via LibraryScreen.CSS_PATH, and
the chooser bug needs the screen's focus-on-open):

- task-31221: the app-global ``*:focus`` solid outline (core/_reset.tcss)
  paints OVER a widget's outermost rows without costing geometry; the
  screen focuses the option-count-height type chooser on open, so with the
  common two-option catalogue the outline covered every option — an empty
  bordered band, selection blind. Third widget bitten after TASK-1160
  (DataTable) and TASK-2300 (SelectOverlay).
- task-31222: ``#library-media-reader-mode-read`` had no height rule (an
  unstyled Vertical defaulted to 1fr, holding a blank band above the Find
  bar) while ``#library-media-viewer-content`` was capped at 18 rows
  regardless of terminal size.
