### ❌ FAILING TESTS (32 total)

#### 1. Reactive Value Issues (Primary cause - affects 29 tests)
These tests fail because they check reactive values outside of a Textual app context:

**Widget Tests (14 failures)**:
- `test_tree_node_creation_file` - checking `node.expanded == False`
- `test_tree_node_creation_directory` - same issue
- `test_directory_icon_states` - accessing `node.expanded`
- All tests using `widget_pilot` fixture that try to mount widgets
- Tests checking `is_loading`, `selected`, `expanded` reactive values

**Integration Tests (14 failures)**:
- All tests in `test_code_repo_copy_paste_window.py`
- Same issue: checking `window.is_loading == False` outside app context

**Property Tests (3 failures)**:
- `test_file_node_properties` - reactive value checks
- `test_directory_node_properties` - reactive value checks
- `TestTreeViewStateMachine` - creating widgets with reactive values

#### 2. Test Infrastructure Issues (3 tests)
- Some async tests may have issues with the `widget_pilot` fixture
- The fixture tries to create a test app but reactive values don't work properly

## Root Causes

1. **Reactive Values**: Textual's `reactive()` descriptors return special objects when accessed outside of a running Textual app. The tests need to either:
   - Run within a full Textual app context
   - Access the internal value directly
   - Use simplified mocks that don't use reactive values

2. **Async Test Setup**: Some integration tests have complex async setup that may not work correctly with the test fixtures.

## Recommendations

1. **For Reactive Value Tests**: 
   - Use the simplified tests approach (like `test_repo_tree_widgets_simple.py`)
   - Or create a proper Textual test app context
   - Or access reactive values using internal APIs

2. **For Integration Tests**:
   - May need to refactor to use Textual's built-in testing utilities
   - Or mock the reactive values at a lower level

3. **For Property Tests**:
   - Create widgets without reactive values for testing
   - Or use mocks that simulate the behavior

## Summary
The core functionality is working correctly (as evidenced by the simple tests passing), but tests that interact with Textual's reactive system outside of a proper app context fail. This is a testing infrastructure issue rather than a functionality issue.
