# Media View Layout Fixing Attempts - Complete Failure Log

## Problem Description
The Media window is squished to the left. The navigation sidebar shows, but the content area is extremely narrow showing only a thin slice of the media items list. The metadata/content/analysis section is completely missing.

## Failed Attempt #1: Adding dock: left to nav pane
**What I tried:** Added `dock: left` to `.media-nav-pane` in CSS
**Why it failed:** Made it worse. Docking isn't the issue - the overall layout structure is broken.

## Failed Attempt #2: Using Horizontal instead of Grid
**What I tried:** Changed Grid to Horizontal in MediaWindow.py
**Why it failed:** The CSS was written for Grid layout with `.media-view-area Grid` selector. Changing to Horizontal broke the CSS selector matching.

## Failed Attempt #3: Adding display: flex
**What I tried:** Added `display: flex` to CSS
**Why it failed:** Textual doesn't support `display: flex`. Only supports `display: block` or `display: none`. Got a CSS parsing error.

## Failed Attempt #4: Wrapping nav pane in extra container
**What I tried:** Wrapped VerticalScroll in a Container with id="media-nav-container"
**Why it failed:** Added unnecessary nesting without fixing the core layout issue.

## Failed Attempt #5: Using fr units for widths
**What I tried:** Changed widths to use 1fr and 2fr
**Why it failed:** Didn't address the fundamental layout problem.

## Failed Attempt #6: Adding layout: horizontal to MediaWindow
**What I tried:** Added `layout: horizontal` to MediaWindow DEFAULT_CSS
**Why it failed:** MediaWindow already inherits from .window class which has horizontal layout. This didn't fix the actual problem.

## Failed Attempt #7: Changing back to Grid from Horizontal
**What I tried:** Reverted Horizontal back to Grid to match CSS selector
**Why it failed:** Still didn't work. The issue might be deeper than just the container type.

## What I Keep Missing
1. I keep focusing on the MediaWindow level layout, but the issue might be with how the window is mounted or styled by its parent
2. I haven't checked if MediaWindow is actually getting the .window class
3. I haven't verified if the #media-window ID styling is being applied
4. I keep assuming the CSS is being applied but haven't verified it

## The Real Problem (Hypothesis)
The issue might be:
1. MediaWindow isn't getting proper width from its parent container
2. The .window class isn't being applied properly
3. There's a conflict between DEFAULT_CSS and the external CSS file
4. The Grid/Horizontal container inside media-view-area might not be the issue at all

## What I Should Check Next
1. How MediaWindow is yielded in app.py and what classes/styles it gets
2. Whether the .window class CSS is actually being applied
3. If there's something constraining MediaWindow's width from the parent
4. The actual rendered CSS properties using Textual's developer tools

## New Findings After Investigation
1. MediaWindow IS created with `classes="window"` and `id="media-window"`
2. The parent container #content has `width: 100%` and `height: 1fr`
3. The .window class has `width: 100%`, `height: 100%`, `layout: horizontal`
4. The CSS selectors SHOULD all be matching

## Current Theory
Since all the CSS should be working, the issue might be:
1. The nav pane lost its fixed width during our changes
2. CSS specificity conflicts
3. The Grid layout inside media-view-area might not be getting proper width to distribute

## What's Actually Broken
Looking at the screenshot:
- The nav sidebar (Media Types) is visible but narrow
- The content area is extremely narrow
- The Grid with 35%/65% columns can't work if the Grid itself has no width

## Failed Attempt #8: Adding width to .media-nav-pane
**What I tried:** Added `width: 100%` to `.media-nav-pane`
**Why it failed:** The nav pane width wasn't the issue. The overall layout is still broken.

## New Discovery
1. The media view areas have `display: none` by default
2. When shown, they're set to `display: "block"`
3. `activate_initial_view` IS called by app.py when switching to media tab
4. This should show the "all-media" view

## Critical Question
Is the content pane (#media-content-pane) actually expanding to fill the space? It has `width: 1fr` but maybe that's not working.

## The Real Issue (I think)
We wrapped the nav pane in an extra Container during our attempts. The structure is now:
- MediaWindow (horizontal)
  - Container#media-nav-container (width: 30) <- EXTRA WRAPPER WE ADDED
    - VerticalScroll.media-nav-pane
  - Container#media-content-pane (width: 1fr)

But the original structure was probably:
- MediaWindow (horizontal)
  - VerticalScroll.media-nav-pane (width: 30) <- DIRECT CHILD
  - Container#media-content-pane (width: 1fr)

The extra wrapper might be breaking the horizontal layout!

## Failed Attempt #9: Removing the container wrapper
**What I tried:** Removed the extra Container wrapper around nav pane
**Progress:** The main layout is MUCH better! Nav sidebar is properly sized, content area expands.
**Still broken:** The Grid inside media-view-area isn't working. The media list and details are stacked vertically instead of side by side.

## Current Status (from latest screenshot)
- ✅ Navigation sidebar (Media Types) is properly sized on the left
- ✅ Content area fills the remaining space
- ❌ Inside the content area, the Grid isn't creating 2 columns
- ❌ Media items list and metadata/details are stacked vertically instead of horizontally

## The ACTUAL Problem
The Grid CSS selector `.media-view-area Grid` expects the Grid to be INSIDE an element with class media-view-area. But our structure has the Grid AS the element with class media-view-area:

```python
with Grid(id=view_id, classes="media-view-area"):
```

So the CSS selector doesn't match! We need to change the selector to just `.media-view-area` or `Grid.media-view-area`.
