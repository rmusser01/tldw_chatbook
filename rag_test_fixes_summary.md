# RAG Test Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Hanging Property-Based Tests
**Problem**: The `test_chunk_by_sentences_preserves_boundaries` test was hanging due to unbounded text generation in Hypothesis strategies.

**Solution**:
- Added size constraints to text generation strategies (reduced max_size from 1000 to 500)
- Added `@settings` decorators with:
  - `max_examples` limits (10-50 depending on test complexity)
  - `deadline` timeouts (1000-2000ms)
  - `suppress_health_check=[HealthCheck.too_slow]` where needed
- Simplified text generation strategy to avoid infinite loops

### 2. Missing NLTK Data
**Problem**: Tests were failing due to missing `punkt_tab` tokenizer data.

**Solution**:
- Updated `chunking_service.py` to check for both `punkt` and `punkt_tab` tokenizers
- Added fallback download attempts for both tokenizer versions
- Added `@pytest.mark.skipif(not NLTK_AVAILABLE)` to sentence-based tests

### 3. API Mismatch
**Problem**: Tests were calling public method `chunk_by_words` instead of private method `_chunk_by_words`.

**Solution**:
- All tests now correctly use the private methods with underscore prefix

### 4. State Machine Test Configuration
**Problem**: State machine test wasn't properly configured with Hypothesis settings.

**Solution**:
- Fixed the TestCacheStateMachine class instantiation
- Added proper settings for state machine tests
- Constrained float generation to avoid NaN/Infinity values

### 5. Whitespace Handling Test
**Problem**: `test_short_text_single_chunk` was failing due to whitespace normalization (carriage returns converted to spaces).

**Solution**:
- Updated test to compare word lists instead of exact text
- This properly handles the chunking service's whitespace normalization

## Test Performance Improvements

All property-based tests now have:
- Bounded input generation to prevent infinite loops
- Reasonable example counts (10-50 instead of default 100+)
- Deadline settings to catch hanging tests early
- Proper cleanup in stateful tests

## Files Modified

1. `/Tests/RAG/test_rag_properties.py` - Main test file with all fixes
2. `/tldw_chatbook/RAG_Search/Services/chunking_service.py` - NLTK data handling improvements

## Running the Tests

To run the fixed tests:
```bash
# Ensure NLTK data is downloaded
python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt'); nltk.download('punkt_tab')"

# Run all RAG property tests
pytest Tests/RAG/test_rag_properties.py -xvs

# Run specific test class
pytest Tests/RAG/test_rag_properties.py::TestChunkingServiceProperties -xvs
```

All tests should now complete within reasonable time limits without hanging.

## Service Factory Test Fixes

### Additional Issues Fixed

#### 1. Async Test Configuration
**Problem**: Tests using async functions were failing with "async def functions are not natively supported"
**Solution**: Added `--asyncio-mode=auto` to pytest.ini configuration

#### 2. Missing Import in service_factory.py
**Problem**: `service_factory.py` was missing import for `DEPENDENCIES_AVAILABLE`
**Solution**: Added `from ...Utils.optional_deps import DEPENDENCIES_AVAILABLE`

#### 3. Missing Methods in EmbeddingsService
**Problem**: Tests expected three methods that weren't implemented
**Solution**: Implemented the following methods in `embeddings_service.py`:
- `clear_collection()` - Clears a collection by deleting and recreating it
- `update_documents()` - Updates existing documents in a collection
- `delete_documents()` - Deletes specific documents from a collection

#### 4. Missing Factory Methods
**Problem**: Tests expected several factory methods that weren't implemented
**Solution**: Added the following methods to `service_factory.py`:
- `create_chunking_service()`
- `create_cache_service()`
- `create_memory_management_service()`
- `create_rag_service()`

#### 5. Circular Reference Setup
**Problem**: `test_memory_manager_circular_reference` expected the factory to set up circular reference
**Solution**: Modified `create_memory_management_service()` to call `embeddings_service.set_memory_manager(memory_manager)`

#### 6. Performance Configuration
**Problem**: Test expected performance settings to be applied to embeddings service
**Solution**: Added performance configuration logic in `create_embeddings_service()` to apply settings from RAG config

#### 7. Error Handling
**Problem**: Test expected graceful error handling when service creation fails
**Solution**: Added try-except block in `create_embeddings_service()` to catch exceptions and return None

#### 8. Custom Configuration Support
**Problem**: Test expected ability to pass custom configurations
**Solution**: Updated `create_complete_rag_services()` signature to accept custom `rag_config` and handle `embeddings_dir` alias

### Additional Files Modified for Service Factory Tests

1. `/Users/appledev/Working/tldw_chatbook_dev/pytest.ini`
   - Added asyncio mode configuration

2. `/Users/appledev/Working/tldw_chatbook_dev/tldw_chatbook/RAG_Search/Services/service_factory.py`
   - Added missing import
   - Implemented 4 missing factory methods
   - Added circular reference setup
   - Added performance configuration
   - Added error handling
   - Updated method signatures for custom config support

3. `/Users/appledev/Working/tldw_chatbook_dev/tldw_chatbook/RAG_Search/Services/embeddings_service.py`
   - Implemented 3 missing methods

4. Multiple test files in `/Users/appledev/Working/tldw_chatbook_dev/Tests/RAG/`
   - Added @pytest.mark.asyncio decorators to async test functions

### Service Factory Test Results
All 15 tests in `test_service_factory.py` are now passing. The fixes addressed both implementation gaps and test configuration issues, ensuring the RAG service factory works correctly with proper error handling, performance configuration, and circular reference management.
