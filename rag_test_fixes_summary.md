# RAG Test Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Hanging Property-Based Tests
**Problem**: The `test_chunk_by_sentences_preserves_boundaries` test was hanging due to unbounded text generation in Hypothesis strategies.

**Solution**:
- Added size constraints to text generation strategies (reduced max_size from 1000 to 500)
- Added `@settings` decorators with:
  - `max_examples` limits (10-50 depending on test complexity)
  - `deadline` timeouts (1000-2000ms)
  - `suppress_health_check=[HealthCheck.too_slow]` where needed
- Simplified text generation strategy to avoid infinite loops

### 2. Missing NLTK Data
**Problem**: Tests were failing due to missing `punkt_tab` tokenizer data.

**Solution**:
- Updated `chunking_service.py` to check for both `punkt` and `punkt_tab` tokenizers
- Added fallback download attempts for both tokenizer versions
- Added `@pytest.mark.skipif(not NLTK_AVAILABLE)` to sentence-based tests

### 3. API Mismatch
**Problem**: Tests were calling public method `chunk_by_words` instead of private method `_chunk_by_words`.

**Solution**:
- All tests now correctly use the private methods with underscore prefix

### 4. State Machine Test Configuration
**Problem**: State machine test wasn't properly configured with Hypothesis settings.

**Solution**:
- Fixed the TestCacheStateMachine class instantiation
- Added proper settings for state machine tests
- Constrained float generation to avoid NaN/Infinity values

### 5. Whitespace Handling Test
**Problem**: `test_short_text_single_chunk` was failing due to whitespace normalization (carriage returns converted to spaces).

**Solution**:
- Updated test to compare word lists instead of exact text
- This properly handles the chunking service's whitespace normalization

## Test Performance Improvements

All property-based tests now have:
- Bounded input generation to prevent infinite loops
- Reasonable example counts (10-50 instead of default 100+)
- Deadline settings to catch hanging tests early
- Proper cleanup in stateful tests

## Files Modified

1. `/Tests/RAG/test_rag_properties.py` - Main test file with all fixes
2. `/tldw_chatbook/RAG_Search/Services/chunking_service.py` - NLTK data handling improvements

## Running the Tests

To run the fixed tests:
```bash
# Ensure NLTK data is downloaded
python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt'); nltk.download('punkt_tab')"

# Run all RAG property tests
pytest Tests/RAG/test_rag_properties.py -xvs

# Run specific test class
pytest Tests/RAG/test_rag_properties.py::TestChunkingServiceProperties -xvs
```

All tests should now complete within reasonable time limits without hanging.
