# MediaWindowV88 Runtime Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. `call_from_thread` Error
**Problem**: MediaWindowV88 (a Container) doesn't have `call_from_thread` method
**Solution**: Changed to use `self.app.call_from_thread()` instead in `load_media_details()`

### 2. Search Toggle Button Event Propagation
**Problem**: Button presses were bubbling up to app-level handler causing "Unhandled button press" warnings
**Solution**: Added `event.stop()` to all button handlers in search_bar.py to prevent propagation

### 3. Metadata Panel Mount Error (already handled)
**Problem**: Error during mount trying to call non-existent method
**Note**: This appears to be from old code - current code already has proper `_exit_edit_mode()` method

## Testing

To verify the fixes work:
1. Run the app
