# Media Analysis Navigation and Edit Mode Fixes

## Issues Identified from Logs

1. **Navigation buttons not working**:
   - Log showed: `Handler found: False` and `WARNING: Unhandled button press for ID 'prev-analysis-btn'`
   - The prev/next analysis buttons were not registered in the media event handlers

2. **Edit mode causing window movement**:
   - User reported: "I tried editing it but the window moved and I wasn't able to modify any text inside of it"
   - The issue was caused by dynamically removing and re-mounting widgets

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Navigation Button Handlers
**File**: `tldw_chatbook/Event_Handlers/media_events.py`

Added button handler entries for the navigation buttons:
```python
# Analysis navigation buttons
"prev-analysis-btn": lambda app, event: None,  # Handled by widget itself
"next-analysis-btn": lambda app, event: None,  # Handled by widget itself
```

These are placeholder handlers since the actual navigation logic is handled directly by the widget's `@on` decorators.

### 2. Edit Mode Stability
**File**: `tldw_chatbook/Widgets/Media/media_viewer_panel.py`

#### Changed approach from dynamic widget replacement to visibility toggling:

**Before** (Unstable):
- Removed Markdown widget from DOM
- Mounted TextArea widget in its place
- This caused layout shifts and focus issues

**After** (Stable):
- Both Markdown and TextArea exist in the DOM permanently
- Toggle visibility using CSS classes
- No widgets are removed or added during edit mode

#### Implementation Details:

1. **Updated compose() method**:
```python
# Analysis display area - both view and edit modes
with Container(id="analysis-container"):
    yield Markdown("", id="analysis-display")
    yield TextArea("", id="analysis-edit-area", classes="hidden")
```

2. **Added CSS for container and hidden state**:
```css
MediaViewerPanel #analysis-container {
    height: auto;
    min-height: 10;
    max-height: 30;
    margin: 1;
}

MediaViewerPanel .hidden {
    display: none;
}
```

3. **Simplified edit mode toggle**:
```python
if self.analysis_edit_mode:
    # Switch to edit mode
    edit_area.load_text(self.current_analysis)
    analysis_display.add_class("hidden")
    edit_area.remove_class("hidden")
    edit_area.focus()
else:
    # Exit edit mode
    self.current_analysis = edit_area.text
    analysis_display.update(self.current_analysis)
    edit_area.add_class("hidden")
    analysis_display.remove_class("hidden")
```

4. **Updated navigation to exit edit mode**:
When navigating between analyses, the system now automatically exits edit mode to prevent confusion.

## Benefits

1. **Stable Layout**: No more window movement or layout shifts when entering/exiting edit mode
2. **Better Performance**: Widgets are created once and reused, not constantly recreated
3. **Improved Focus Management**: The TextArea properly receives focus when entering edit mode
4. **Navigation Works**: Previous/Next buttons are now properly handled
5. **Consistent Experience**: Edit mode automatically exits when navigating to prevent data loss

## User Experience Improvements

- Edit button toggles between view and edit modes smoothly
- No visual jumping or window movement
- Text area is properly focused for immediate editing
- Navigation between multiple analyses works seamlessly
- Edit mode state is properly managed across navigation
