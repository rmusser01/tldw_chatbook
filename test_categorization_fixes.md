# Test Categorization Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to properly categorize tests in the tldw_chatbook project. Several tests were incorrectly categorized as integration tests when they were actually unit tests due to heavy mocking.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Unit Test Markers
The following test files were updated to include `@pytest.mark.unit` markers:

#### Event Handler Tests
- **`Tests/Event_Handlers/Chat_Events/test_chat_events_sidebar.py`**
  - Added: `pytestmark = [pytest.mark.asyncio, pytest.mark.unit]`
  - Reason: Uses comprehensive mock app and mocks all database calls

- **`Tests/Event_Handlers/Chat_Events/test_chat_streaming_events.py`**
  - Added: `pytestmark = [pytest.mark.asyncio, pytest.mark.unit]`
  - Reason: Uses comprehensive mock app and patches database modules

#### LLM Management Tests
- **`Tests/LLM_Management/test_llm_management_events.py`**
  - Added: `pytestmark = [pytest.mark.asyncio, pytest.mark.unit]`
  - Reason: Mocks app, filesystem (Path), and all UI widgets

- **`Tests/LLM_Management/test_mlx_lm.py`**
  - Added: `pytestmark = pytest.mark.unit`
  - Reason: Mocks subprocess.Popen, settings, and chat function calls

### 2. Mixed Test File Updates
**`Tests/integration/test_core_functionality_without_optional_deps.py`** was updated to properly mark each test:

#### Integration Tests (marked with `@pytest.mark.integration`):
- `test_core_imports_without_optional_deps` - Tests actual imports
- `test_notes_functionality_without_optional_deps` - Tests real service initialization
- `test_character_chat_without_optional_deps` - Tests real functionality
- `test_chunking_without_optional_deps` - Tests real chunking
- `test_optional_deps_module_functionality` - Tests real module functionality
- `test_core_app_import_without_torch` - Tests import behavior with missing deps

#### Unit Tests (marked with `@pytest.mark.unit`):
- `test_ui_components_with_disabled_features` - Uses MagicMock for app
- `test_search_window_chroma_manager_error_handling` - Uses MagicMock for app

## Correctly Categorized Files (No Changes Needed)
- `Tests/Chat/test_chat_features_async.py` - Already a unit test
- `Tests/Chat/test_chat_functions.py` - Already properly mixed with correct markers
- `Tests/Chat/test_chat_integration_APIs.py` - True integration test
- `Tests/Event_Handlers/Chat_Events/test_chat_image_events.py` - Already marked as unit test
- `Tests/integration/test_file_operations_with_validation.py` - True integration test

## Running Tests by Category
With these changes, you can now run tests by category:

```bash
# Run only unit tests
pytest -m unit

# Run only integration tests
pytest -m integration

# Run all tests except integration (useful for CI)
pytest -m "not integration"
```

## Key Indicators Used for Categorization

### Unit Test Indicators:
- Heavy use of `Mock`, `MagicMock`, or `AsyncMock`
- Mocking of external dependencies (database, filesystem, network)
- Testing components in isolation
- No real I/O operations

### Integration Test Indicators:
- Real database operations (even in-memory SQLite)
- Real file I/O operations
- Real network calls or require running services
- Testing interaction between multiple real components
- Minimal or no mocking (except for environment setup)
