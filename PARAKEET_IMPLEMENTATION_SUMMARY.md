# NVIDIA Parakeet TDT Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully added support for NVIDIA Parakeet ASR models to the tldw_chatbook transcription system. Parakeet models offer lower latency and better streaming performance compared to Whisper models.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependencies
- Added `nemo-toolkit[asr]>=1.20.0` to audio, video, and media_processing optional dependencies in `pyproject.toml`

### 2. Core Implementation in `transcription_service.py`
- Added NeMo import handling with graceful degradation
- Implemented `_transcribe_with_parakeet()` method with:
  - Lazy model loading
  - Support for all 6 Parakeet model variants (TDT, CTC, RNN-T in 0.6B and 1.1B sizes)
  - GPU device support (CUDA)
  - Optimizations for streaming (attention windows, chunking)
  - Proper error handling and result formatting
- Updated `transcribe()` method to handle 'parakeet' provider
- Added Parakeet models to `list_available_models()`

### 3. Configuration
- Updated `config.py` to include 'parakeet' as a transcription provider option
- Added Parakeet model names to configuration documentation
- Added example configuration for using Parakeet

### 4. Documentation
- Created comprehensive documentation in `Docs/Development/PARAKEET_TRANSCRIPTION.md`
- Updated README.md to mention Parakeet support and audio/video processing features
- Added example script showing how to use Parakeet transcription

### 5. Legacy Code Updates
- Updated `Audio_Transcription_Lib.py` to use the new transcription service for Parakeet
- Fixed import issues (sanitize_filename moved from Utils.Utils to Utils.text)

### 6. Testing
- Created comprehensive test suite for Parakeet functionality
- Tests cover model loading, transcription, error handling, and configuration

## Key Features

### Supported Models
- **nvidia/parakeet-tdt-1.1b** - Transducer model optimized for streaming
- **nvidia/parakeet-ctc-1.1b** - CTC model for fast batch processing
- **nvidia/parakeet-rnnt-1.1b** - RNN-Transducer for balanced performance
- Plus 0.6B variants of each for resource-constrained environments

### Advantages
- **Low Latency**: Optimized for real-time transcription
- **Streaming Support**: Built-in optimizations for long audio
- **GPU Acceleration**: Full CUDA support
- **Production Ready**: Designed for deployment at scale

## Usage Example

```python
from tldw_chatbook.Local_Ingestion.transcription_service import TranscriptionService

service = TranscriptionService()
result = service.transcribe(
    audio_path="audio.wav",
    provider="parakeet",
    model="nvidia/parakeet-tdt-1.1b"
)
print(result['text'])
```

## Configuration Example

```toml
[transcription]
default_provider = "parakeet"
default_model = "nvidia/parakeet-tdt-1.1b"
device = "cuda"
use_vad_by_default = true
```

## Next Steps
Future enhancements could include:
- Timestamp extraction from Parakeet models
- Streaming transcription API
- Speaker diarization integration
- Fine-tuning support for domain-specific models

## Notes
- The implementation gracefully handles missing dependencies
- Falls back to other providers if NeMo is not installed
- All existing transcription features remain compatible
