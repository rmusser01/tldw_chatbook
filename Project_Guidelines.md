# Project_Guidelines

Taken from: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40492544

If I had to sum up my own right now, without much thought:

1. keep the project actually alive by ensuring there is clear evidence to all of continuous, significant development.

2. be respectful to all those currently involved, and to all who wish to become involved.

3. always remain open to the possibility that I'm doing something wrong, and eagerly seek out criticism that may reveal that to be the case.

4. notwithstanding #3, accept that I am the expert of experts in most senses, and have accumulated a lot of domain and application specific knowledge along the way; do not get hustled by newcomers.

5. notwithstanding #4, acknowledgement that newcomers may have ideas that hold the key to improving usability, discoverability, functionality and more. In general, strive to give their ideas serious attention.

6. Be nice. Be kind. Be respectful. Answer (most) questions asked of me personally.

7. When it is possible to financially compensate people for significant participation, do so.

8. Always acknowledge the contributions of others.

9. Promote the idea of my own humanity and that of all those involved, in order to encourage kind behavior and an understanding of what is possible (or not).

10. Always remember that it is other people who make my work possible, not me.
