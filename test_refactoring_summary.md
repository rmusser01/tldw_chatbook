# Test Refactoring Summary

## Overview
Refactored the newly created tests to use the existing test infrastructure instead of creating duplicate test files and utilities.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Tools Tests
- **Location**: Added to existing `Tests/UI/test_tools_settings_window.py`
- **What was added**:
  - Test fixtures for creating test databases
  - Tests for individual database operations (vacuum, backup, restore, check integrity)
  - Tests for "All Databases" operations
  - Tests for database status display
  - Tests for chatbook creation/import buttons
  - Error handling tests

### 2. Chatbook Tests
- **Location**: Created `Tests/Character_Chat/test_chatbooks.py` (appropriate existing directory)
- **What was added**:
  - Model tests for chatbook data structures
  - Creator tests for chatbook export functionality
  - Importer tests for chatbook import functionality
  - Property-based tests using Hypothesis
  - Integration tests for full export/import cycle

### 3. Removed Duplicate Infrastructure
- Deleted `/Tests/DatabaseTools/` directory
- Deleted `/Tests/Chatbooks/` directory
- Deleted duplicate test support files:
  - `test_readme.md`
  - `test_requirements.txt`
  - `conftest_chatbooks.py`

### 4. Fixed Import Issues
- Fixed incorrect class names in chatbook imports:
  - `RAGDatabase` → `RAGIndexingDB`
  - `EvalsDatabase` → `EvalsDB`
  - `SubscriptionsDatabase` → `SubscriptionsDB`

## Key Improvements

1. **Reused Existing Fixtures**:
   - Used `chacha_db_factory` and `media_db_factory` from `test_utilities.py`
   - Used `DatabasePopulator` from `db_test_utilities.py`
   - Used `TestDataFactory` for creating test data

2. **Followed Project Conventions**:
   - Tests are now in appropriate existing directories
   - Use the same patterns as other tests in the project
   - No duplicate test infrastructure

3. **Better Integration**:
   - Database tools tests are with other UI tests
   - Chatbook tests are with other character/content tests
   - All tests use the established test framework

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run database tools tests
pytest Tests/UI/test_tools_settings_window.py -k "database_tools"

# Run chatbook tests
pytest Tests/Character_Chat/test_chatbooks.py

# Run all new tests
pytest Tests/UI/test_tools_settings_window.py Tests/Character_Chat/test_chatbooks.py
```

## Notes
- The tests may need TextualTest or AppTest to run properly (currently skipped in some environments)
- All tests use the existing test infrastructure - no new dependencies or patterns introduced
- Import errors in the chatbook modules have been fixed
