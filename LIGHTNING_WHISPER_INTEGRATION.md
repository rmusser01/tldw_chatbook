# Lightning Whisper MLX Integration Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated lightning-whisper-mlx as the standard transcription backend for macOS in tldw_chatbook. This provides 10x faster transcription compared to Whisper CPP and 4x faster than standard MLX implementations.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Dependencies (`pyproject.toml`)
- Added `lightning-whisper-mlx` to optional dependencies with platform restriction for macOS
- Included in `audio`, `video`, and `media_processing` groups
- Created new `mlx_whisper` optional dependency group

### 2. Dependency Checking (`Utils/optional_deps.py`)
- Added `lightning_whisper_mlx` to dependency tracking
- Implemented platform-specific checking (only available on Darwin/macOS)
- Integrated into audio processing dependency checks

### 3. Transcription Service (`Local_Ingestion/transcription_service.py`)
- Added import checking for lightning-whisper-mlx with platform detection
- Implemented `_transcribe_with_lightning_whisper_mlx()` method with:
  - Batched decoding support (default batch_size=12)
  - Quantization options (None, 4-bit, 8-bit)
  - Model caching for performance
  - Progress callback support
  - Proper error handling
- Added to available providers list (shows first on macOS)
- Updated model listings with all supported Whisper models
- Set as default provider on macOS when available

### 4. Documentation (`Docs/Features/TRANSCRIPTION_PROVIDERS.md`)
- Added Lightning-Whisper-MLX to comparison table
- Created detailed provider profile with strengths, limitations, and use cases
- Updated hardware recommendations for Apple Silicon
- Added specific configuration examples

### 5. Test Script (`test_lightning_whisper.py`)
- Created comprehensive test script to verify integration
- Checks platform compatibility
- Verifies dependency availability
- Tests provider detection and model listing
- Supports testing with actual audio files

## Installation

On macOS with Apple Silicon:
```bash
# Install with audio support
pip install -e ".[audio]"

# Or specifically for MLX whisper
pip install -e ".[mlx_whisper]"

# Or just the package directly
pip install lightning-whisper-mlx
```

## Usage

The integration is seamless - on macOS, lightning-whisper-mlx will be the default provider if installed. Users can:

1. Use it automatically as the default on macOS
2. Explicitly select it in the UI
3. Configure it via settings:
   ```toml
   [transcription]
   default_provider = "lightning-whisper-mlx"
   lightning_batch_size = 12
   lightning_quant = null  # or "4bit", "8bit"
   ```

## Testing

Run the test script:
```bash
python test_lightning_whisper.py [audio_file.mp3]
```

## Benefits

1. **Performance**: 10x faster than Whisper CPP, 4x faster than standard MLX
2. **Efficiency**: Optimized for Apple Silicon's unified memory
3. **Flexibility**: Supports all Whisper models including distilled variants
4. **Integration**: Seamless drop-in replacement with automatic fallback

## Future Enhancements

The UI could be enhanced to show batch size and quantization options when lightning-whisper-mlx is selected (marked as low priority in implementation).

## Notes

- Only available on macOS with Apple Silicon
- Falls back to faster-whisper on other platforms
- Maintains full compatibility with existing transcription workflows
