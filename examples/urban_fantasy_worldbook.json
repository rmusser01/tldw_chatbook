It's maintained by the collective unconscious disbelief of humanity and reinforced by the Treaty of Shadows (1692). When mundane humans witness magic, the Veil causes them to rationalize it away or forget entirely. Only those with supernatural blood, magical training, or who've been 'awakened' can see through the Veil. The Bureau of Supernatural Affairs monitors Veil breaches, with Memory Adjustment Teams deployed for serious incidents.",
